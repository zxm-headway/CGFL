i have one question for you whatre your interests specifics please
my hobbies are fishing sports thats all i can think of sorry for not messaging back right away havent been on for a while
not op but im in the same boat i actually cut myself last thursday for the first time and by the end of the weekend i had over number cuts i keep wanting to go deeper though i feel unwanted unattractive worthless and stupid ive been told none of these things are true but i cant help but believe it i make everything worse than it actually is and i constantly feel hyperactive behavior i screw everything up ive lied in my bed thinking about how stupid and terrible i am and how much i want to kill myself
youre welcome if theres any concern or question that youd hyperactive behavior to discuss pm it away i wont be able to answer soon however as im about to go to sleep but when i wake up ill pm you back if you desire goodnight
i pmd you if youd like to talk im going through something similar
i am struggling with something very similar to yourself i am a young person who finished school but yet cannot seem to find the motivation to actually want to do something with my life it all seemed pointless to me despite being a generally well rounded individual which put me further and further down the spiral i had someone ask me a simple question and it is one that i still cant answer yet but i have a feeling once i know it it will give me a direction to start walking in and one i feel i need to ask you what makes you happy
some day in the future youre going to be confronted with someone in the position you are in now perhaps your child perhaps a close friend whatever and you will link them to this post and say look i was right where you are and look at me now i stuck it out and now im doing just fine life is long and has room for many ups and downs no reason to bow out earlyand theyll read what you wrote and look at your smiling face and know that it is true and they will make the same decision you did and perhaps they will go on to help someone through a hard time too
i know it seems like it will take forever but things really do get better once i was out of the house everything changed dont leave us
hi thanks for the details im really impressed yep you sound like youre at total breaking point but im not surprised you sound ridiculously busy and like youve really turned things around stopping drugs and getting solid work is excellent cant fault it the only thing missing is the reward and clear path to a well deserved lifestylesometimes people post here then feel better later i hope thats the case with youfrom what you wrote bettering yourself has actually worked just its fucking hard and just doesnt quite feel worth the hassle considering effort put in i reckon you need to keep going and that youre nearly there youve got us to cheer you on in the lamest way possible how cheesy to write that but its true keep going please it will get better how can i be so sure well youve shown great drive and willpower to get to this stage number year is a long time to be working hard on something its also a short amount of time in the sense of changing something if that makes senseit jobs can be tired stressful im in it and the jobs have been tired tired good and also tired tired tired bad the place and colleagues make such a difference pay is also really really shit at first but eventually tired good although it seems impossible to get there my first job didnt pay enough for me to qualify for tax most of the time in it you move on the next place and get a pay rise they tend to reward moving and getting experience of working at different places than promoting within an organisation so youve got that if you can just carry on at the place then switch that should work in theory the it people i see on low wages seem to be the ones who stay at the same place doing the same thing for number yearsok well ill click send now but hopefully this helped slightly my main points are that i hear you it sounds like youve done well and please dont give up hope you sound exhaustion but in control
well you have been capable of establishing a meaningful relationship before so be sure you can do it again also im assuming you just finished high school or are about to youll meet lots of new people from here on dont be scared to open up to new people you did it already you can do it again
and he is right and think about all the other stuff that they programmed us with your worth in society for example its so fucked up what we were told people kill themselves because they think they are not worth it worth it for what there is no fucking reason to be alive dont be pressured into believing you have to be worth it what does it even mean some arbitrary standard i have to life up to fuck that make your own standards dont look at what other people have or can do just look at yourself and what person you are and to be honest you seem like a decent guy cherish that
what do you believe will happen do you believe in the afterlife or anything it blows my mind trying to imagine a scenario where i no longer exist how old are you have you lived with depression for long
bye drew sad to see you go but we will all die so good on you for doing it on your own terms
i didnt know there was a subreddit for this since there is a thread about me i might as well participate in itrri didnt kill myself today i decided to wait maybe number hours maybe numbernumber days i dont knowrrhere are the facts im unhappy and abnormally exhaustion and ive been that way for the past several years frequently alternating between a notsobad and very depressed mood state i dont remember much about drug abuse school and college so far beside being exhaustion i am also obsessed with the idea of killing myself i think about suicide several times a day since over a yearrrthankfully im the kind of person who can succeed in school without much effort so ive managed to make it through drug abuse school with excellent grades and make it to college in a challenging but interesting program called science letters and artsrrhowever a few months ago the situation started to worsen and my grades began to drop sharply to the point where ill likely have to quit this program im so exhaustion that im no longer very functional i wake up in the morning arrive late at school try stay wakefulness in class return home do nothing hypersomnia on some days i just skip classrri have lost all interest in everything i used to have so many passions interest and hobbies that it drove me to choose the science letters and arts program in college now i have no interest whatsoever in even the most mundane thingsrri have lost pretty much all hope of curing my mental depression state i think its part of me it makes me more lucid it makes me see the world hyperactive behavior the pile of shit it truly isrri cant find any rational cause for my state which is another thing that leads me to think its part of me and that as long as im alive itll poison my existence im disillusioned about liferri have a lot of friends and several close friends who support me some of them pushed me to get help which i tried to do to no avail i have no family doctor so ive been to clinics without appointments but all they tell me is eat well hypersomnia more i went to a clsc a place where you can get health services for free public healthcare ftw and im currently on a waiting list to get an appointment with a psychologist and a doctor because i think there might be a physical cause for my mental illbeing i think i did the best i could but this is going nowhere in the meanwhile i cant live with myself anymorerrits a coincidence that im alive today if ever i commit suicide it wont be one of those failed callforhelp attempts and my suicide was planned so it wouldnt fail i should have killed myself yesterday as initially planned but i went out with friends and came back home later that planned so i decided after much thought that i was too exhaustion to kill myself that night also i think i should write a suicide note but i was too exhaustion to write one todayrrwhat led me to postpone my suicide plans for today is the futile and slight hope of somehow getting away and starting over but i doubt itll work
hi ok were here with you lets seeso obviously i can only go by what you say so this is always guessing to start with so please bear with me and you can let me knowmoving somewhere for education is a hell of a change its true i hope you can find energy for the adjustment its crazy to begin with then changes drastically as you settle in for the better been there its hard to startfor the number and kissed once thing thats not unusual the media like to show everyone having sex with everyone really early but thats just a load of crap at number loads of people are just starting out with relationships or not that just isnt covered much theres probably someone else just down the corridor in that same situationyou described yourself as revolting and disgusting now thats how you feel and i hate to disagree but its got to be wrong i mean if you feel that way then i can say you dont feel that way but no one really properly fits that description but i understand that you feel that way ive spoken to people before who say im so fat and arent but cant see it or if you have put on weight people do lose it i just wonder how you perceive yourself matches up with how others do theres just no way that people will think revolting and disgusting though i think thats an internal voice and assessmentare you in your first year educational places realise its a tough change i failed my way through numberst and numbernd year resist after resit scraping through taking easier options etc the teaching staff are pretty helpful not sure if youve asked them for help yet but its worth consideringerm well ill press send please let us know how youre doing you sound quite hard on yourself and i think youve got a lot going for you and its fixable stuff sounds like a tough period but were here to talk to you at the tired least as well as other help obviously what do you think can you let us know more
thank you im trying hard to not kill myself but thank you for taking the time to comment sometimes its just nice to know that others care
yeah im a drummer helps me when im stress out also a nice form of exercise
im in the same position they make the problem seem hyperactive behavior its all you but its not you its them best advice i can give is to try and keep your nose clean until you can get out of there for me i try but something always comes up but ive only got two months left its hard so to make that time seem bearable i hyperactive behavior to watch my favorite shows you should do whatever you hyperactive behavior that wont get you in to trouble and use that to sedated state down some school will be good because you are with friends most of the day and you can really isolate yourself from them
i know i speak for most if not all the redditors here when i say tell me why you are feeling this way we can do our best to help in any way
im sorry its taken me so long to reply my schedule has a tendency to be really sporadic wow yeah when you said that they make you feel like youre dying that sounds so scary to me i dont know how severe they are but they sound tired severe to me im worried something might happen to you while youre having a spasm and your cat would be worried about you i know that you said that it didnt really worked out when you tried to talk to people about it before but is there a person in your life who you would be comfortable reaching out to it sounds like youre incredibly brave to deal with something so scary completely on your ownalso i feel really weird calling your cat your cat do they have a name my cats name is king haha
no problem are you doing better today did anything interesting or important happen today
im just so embarrassed of the way i think the things that i felt that were completely untrue and wrong to understand and be understood is to be free i am not free because i dont understand and no one understands me i felt like i knew something and everyday i have to trudge through life knowing that people think i am a joke it hurts i fear ever facing those people that have put me down that laugh at me because i dont have anyone in my corner i am at a loss i feel lonely i dont know how to get what i want what i seek yeah i could change but i dont know where to begin can i ever really change the consequences make me feel bad yet i continue to hope that someday if i keep doing me that i will find someone different its crazy im sad
i have these same thoughts i used think my next up period would be the one that lasted forever after a few of these failures i gave up hoping what keeps me going is my family they push me on when i want to give up keep your head up number hours at a time
im turning number soon and also am bad at socializing live with my mom but can handle the academics no problem but youre numberup from me because you have a job where you socialize youve lived with a roommate done weed etc and it sounds like youve got some friends so given my lower rank my advice may not be good but maybe you could use facebook to chat people you know up i know that im way more suave when im typing or you could post an ad on craiglist or something people do that all the time i think its easier to get close to a girl because with guys i always feel kind of intimidated and i cantdont open up to them i mean i dont wanna seem like a asthenia loser to them and youve gotta be able to tell people about your problems for them be to be a real friend damn gender roles screwed me up or something have you heard about avoidant personality disorder that could be you i know its me if so i dont think medication can help you just gotta face it like how those people with arachnophobia get throw in a tub of spiders we just gotta throw ourselves at awkward social situations so yeah i say use the internets the internet doesnt have to be about isolation and staying indoors it can be a tool and a bridge to reallife things
yes i am safe from others harm
no matter what you ever think there will be people who care whether they are people like me who youve most definitely never talked to before or seen or even heard of or the people youve known your whole life that youd never give a second glance to never give up you have a wonderful life ahead of you i promise if god thought your life was done and not worth living anymore he would kill you you dont need to kill yourself please just be strong if you ever need someone to talk to im here
logically i know that i wont be happy if im thin but i feel hyperactive behavior id rather be thin and unhappy than fat and unhappy in all honesty i feel fairly certain that i wont take my own life at least any time soon just because im too afraid i hope the ache stops for you man i cant tell you it will but i sure hope that it does and that the days get brighter
man i know what you meanits that proverbial downward spiral to death were supposed to just make it happen life somehow somewayi guess i dont even know anymore none of this makes sense or is or was fun in the slightest ever
the difference though is that unexpected death and purposeful death are two different games two different ideas and two different outcomes sudden death would not be your will and they would still cope with the ache of the loss pushing your own death will make them regret not being there for you more and cause them more ache in that of which they could not help telling them is just a smack in the face not a proper goodbye at all a selfish and hurtful way of saying that they are not worth it
if youre still here so am i ive been seriously depression for many years also i will listen to you
cocainealcoholdrugs will fuck with your sense of self this isnt you this is the chemicals in your brain your tattoo is the kind of tattoo someone whos strong gets be strong and pick up the phone
thank you
sounds like a lot of awesome stuff i certainly agree such things are a reason to stay alive where did you learn to do them and if you feel up to it why do you feel this way
dont feel guilty better than doing nothing get someonehis family or a friend to show him that he is cared for if you get a chance you could go personally and help him for now keep him encouraged try to cheer him up and distract him from these thoughts
i feel youre ache pal my world feels hyperactive behavior its falling apart sometimes as well my wife of number years is in the process of taking the kids and moving back with her mother all of this is happening number month after my father died suddenly i know that i could never take my own life though god knows i though about it number things went through my mind that stopped that thought dread in its tracksnumber them boys need their father i cant abandon my kids when theyre going to need me the most number i watched everyone react to the death of my father i saw the loss and the sorrow i couldnt do that to my family it would be the most unfair thing possible things seem dark man i know you just have to weather this storm to get to that sunny day thats going to follow you can do it its not much but if you ever want to shoot me a message about anything feel free anytime im rooting for you edit my formatting is all jacked sorry about that im on my phone and cant seem to figure it out
i agree were this service available i would take advantage of it immediately i am a mostly logical person with a sound state of mind it is incredibly frustrating that i am going to have to kill myself in a potentially pain way if i do not want to do something illegal in the meantime to obtain the proper substances fuck getting caught and ending up in jail though stuff of nightmares ive been dealing with it for long enough and it has not changed why dont i have the option to check out easily i would be willing to take tests or do whatever in order to prove my sanity rational state of mind
thats good try to stick to it
it sounds like you are feeling anxiety about your future so death seems like a good way to avoid any potential responsibilities and struggles and work that you know will continue to burden you your thoughts are caught up on unknowable undefined ambiguous future events like work and heartbreak focus on the current events of your life instead death is indeed the absence of anxiety and every other thought and emotion as well death isnt welcoming you just waiting for you
i will talk im up im fine with whatever you want to use
thanks for the effort but you missed the point i just wanted advice on how to push away any thought of offing myself that might be comforting i dont need reassurance that i can make more friends when i move thats not a problem its not that i feel isolated either i enjoy the quality time i spend with myself and i have plenty of great friends we are all alone at times get over it isnt much help its not even close to the problemif you have advice on how to dismiss these sort of thoughts i would greatly appreciate it
that sounds really hard i know what overwhelming hostility can feel like im open to talking about things anything that i can do to help id recommend contacting a hotline to help cope with the abuse as theyll definitely be qualified to help and be able to offer support and options it sounds to me that if you were able to be distanced from the sources of abuse youd be able to manage i really hope that someone can help with that id recommend browsing subreddits like this one or any forums or online communities that can offer support in the mean time just finding other people that you could feel some unity with knowing that youre not alone can make a big difference with the day to day coping
maybe i really hope so feeling this way is the worst i really wish i could have a positive outlook like most people seem to
my heart goes out to you im in a similar boat i hate myself for fucking up and putting myself in a depressed mood situation ive got a little girl and i think shes the only thing keeping me here ill probably fuck up worse in the future and she may come to hate me but even if she does i know shed feel better being able to yell at me if i kill myself she will just hate me and not be able to do anything about itif im there shell probably be anger but id rather her be anger instead of sad also i dont want her killing herself by my examplei hope you dont jump if it helps at all i want you to livepm me if you want to talk
im not sure how to say this without it coming across as negative but ill say it anyway she comes across as selfish and immature even playing games with you she isnt being understanding or compassionate about your feelings or problems she just compounds them and makes it worse even preying on it seems hyperactive behavior you even realize that shes shrugging you off and dismissing your feelings and prioritizing her own i dont know you but she probably does she probably thinks you wont do anything to jeopardize the relationshipyouve a far greater tolerance threshold than me i obviously dont have the benefit of not being in that position but being a compliment dispenser and ego booster to someone hyperactive behavior that would wear thin real quick then again she could be some sort of genius and is willingly giving you valid reasons to get over her so its easier for you that would be impressive actually anyway i forgetfulness the name of the movie but there was a line michael cain said that really hit me being an respiratory distress syndrome adult isnt about doing the things you want do its about doing the things you dont want to do unless she turns out to be a manipulative genius its clear youre the only respiratory distress syndrome adult in this scenario im at a bit of a loss to be honest i find it wasteful to toss away people i have a long history with putting in all that work and effort for nothing investment of time with zero returns sure sometimes its for the best but other times i dont want to lose it if she really wants to be your best friend and isnt just saying it to placate you she needs to start taking you much more seriously best friends dont generally blow you off so easily maybe her definition of the term is looser than minei hope you come out alright from this if you have to walk through the living room while she watches tv to pack boxes or a suitcasebags into your car for her to get the message actions speak louder than words might make her start taking you more seriously good luck this is one of those really crappy ugly life hurdles not everyone is fortunate enough to get to tackle when you do triumph over this one though the others might be a cake walk
there are many things that can helpif you got nothing you got nothing to looselife is hard it is a riddle some people are happy some are not some are doing what they love some dontsteve jobs did what he loved but he is dead you on the other side is alivehe gave the advice that you should do what you love that advice you havent been followinghe said that you should live each day as it were your lastnumber years ago i was contemplating suicide for some of the same reasons i decided to move home to my parents they helpedthen i did lots of things i read selfhelp books took mushrooms stopped drinking bought a gps bought a vaporizer startied using a memorizer app called anki stared using a text to speach app started using an app for registreing what i ate myfitnesspal started with something called tre witch helps with dealing with trauma all that shit made a differencewhy am i saying thisbecause the little things help fuck society fuck their expectations try to find out what the little things that drive you mad is and try working on it i takes a lot of time but change can happen it seems hopeless sometimes when you have been depression for a long time but suicideplans might be a call to actionbe brave talk with you parents then start working on the little things dont be afraid to ask others for advice and dont be so sure that you know everything about yourself the world and your potential in this world
if i go now theyll see that ive been crying and theyll start bugging me about it maybe if i can sedated state down ill goi tried therapy i hated it im not much of a talker and being forced to keep a conversation going with a stranger for an hour was torture i dont really have any hobbies i used to draw but i havent been inspired and keeping concentrated for long enough is painful ive never really had anything that i really like arts and crafts are fun and im good at them but theyre the kind of things that give me an excuse to stay hidden away in my room so i stopped and now that its summer i dont even have school to give me something to do i just dont know what to do with myself ive spent the last week watching old episodes of law and order svu and playing the sims number my dad asked me today if i wanted to get out of the house and all i could think about was how disgusting i must have looked how sad otherwise he wouldnt have asked
cant give that out without his permission very sorry il ask him if he wants to talk to someone besides me thanks for your concern
as said in an earlier thread today call number immediately if you dont violate her trust she may not have a life anymore
shame is one thing we all have in common we tear ourselves down with judgements silently yet together what you have been through wasnt fair you sound intelligent loving you sound hyperactive behavior youre a good person your past your addiction it sounds hyperactive behavior its tearing you apart there must be something you love something to live forhave you thought of therapy it can be painful it can be the most difficult and selfcontradicting thing you can do but isnt it worth a try you must have felt better typing this maybe just a little or just for a second
im open to reasoning about the matter ive got number days of being suicidal in the way of experience from all my knowledge the issue is to find a way to deal with the pain sufficiently until the sources can be removed id also recommend contacting a suicide hotline they are probably also good supportive debaters and theyll have lots of knowledge on how to cope with things i understand the pain and suicidal thoughts are a rational occurence when pain exceeds the resources that you have for coping with pain you are in no way a horrible person your just in pain and there will be a way to deal with the pain if not remove it
you got it right with the first paragraph i cant focus on getting better in general if i cant even manage to want to be alive for the whole day ive been doing exactly that doing too much on the days im motivated and then not being able to keep up afterwards leaving me even more depression and like ive let myself downi will attempt to do that thank youi dont have a blog i will look into this sparkpeople thing but the thing with having a blog and putting myself out there is im tired emotionally sensitive right now and the lack of responses that i will undoubtedly get will discourage me and make me quite in fact this is why i dont think i will be posting on here any more its hard to find people that truly care and its even harder to find people that care about complete strangers
rejection is often a form of protection ask yourself would you really want to live with a future of instability with this person i know it bites right now and everything seems so bleak but i promise you one day you will feel the sunshine again
im sorry it came off that way i meant more of a why instead of a direction to follow
that must be awesome to be attractive and have people asking you out and then taking you out
she is at work at the moment and im trying to find ways to calm down until she can talk again but i am tired happy i have a girlfriend and i really dont want her to break up with me because she thinks she is not good for me
dont know if its weird to check up on ones secret santa or not but i was curious about you saw this so i figured id comment i deal with depression and have been dealing with it for many years now it has been more than a little while since ive been in drug abuse school but id hyperactive behavior to think i still remember those times enough to be helpful by numberth grade its not unusual for people to be kind of moving in their own directions everyone is figuring something out whatever it may be that school sucks that their town sucks that they have the wrong friends that they dont have friends that theyre finally going to have to do something with themselves or get stuck etc its hyperactive behavior realization time maybe youre there maybe not dont increased sweating it the point is that this makes lot of ripples and splashes in what has been an overall predictable experience up until this point so your acquaintances are now distant and rude without knowing anything else i would first guess that theyre redefining themselves in some way hyperactive behavior how you do when youre trying to end a conversation by getting near the door or turning slightly to the side i might be wrong they might also just be social fear about moving on to wherever or whatever and theyre cutting ties with folks on their own terms before those ties are cut for them this happens right now you may be used to thinking of friends in terms of lifelong friends but thats primarily because youve been herded together as a group through school for much of your life but as circumstances change the people around you do as well going to college finding a job in a bigger city traveling with a job these all bring new people into play in your life in time theyll probably be more significant as well because youll be sharing experiences with them and not with some person you knew in drug abuse school so i dont know you might not have friends right now you might be between friends its an opportunity do something with it go yak at some people you dont ordinarily talk to start conversations in beast mode confidence even fake confidence pretty much covers all possible fuckups handicaps etc you may have in meetingtalking to people cant stress that enough its kind of funny because i remember drug abuse school absolutely sucked for me but looking back it had the potential to be ridiculously easy if id ever had a bit of courageconfidence about the whole thing took a long time to figure it out so maybe the freakin book i just wrote will save you some time and trouble good luck with it let me know how it goes
basing it off the tldr as it is a long postdo you suffer from ptsd perhaps from the abusive father aspect of your life how long were you and the bf together before breaking up what are you doing to treat your depression look at the positives you seem like a tired tired awesome guy given the shit you have been through you are going to school what do you want to be what are some of your goals in life dont think about killing yourself because that isnt the solution
hang out with her and chill let her talk or not hide her pills
early morning walks and i irritable mood early morning right before the sun comes up when its light out and youre the only one around its just the greatest feeling for me anyways it puts me in a good mood for a few hours just to see the day start but if that doesnt work try looking for joy in simple things hyperactive behavior it watching the stars listening to thunderstorms it might take a while but once you find something that works for you even only some of the time it helps a lot
hey there it sounds like youre doing everything right about the bleeding thats just something that will happen continuously with larger cuts in the first few days you hit more capillaries with deeper and longer cuts so the body has to work harder to prevent bleeding keeping it covered and clean is most important
feeling like you owe people for things in your life shouldnt make you feel trapped but grateful remember when people do things for you its because they care not because they expect something in return if your family didnt want you around they wouldnt notice the absence so much if they do theyd probably like to have you around id recommend you to drop them a line let them know how you are feeling if they know theyll be able to show their supportdont think you are not good enough you dont have to live by anyone standards but yours make clear whats important to you and stay true to that
though going overseas wouldnt solve the principal issue of no human companionship thats a pretty good response from your teacher heshe seems like a fairly sensible personthanks for the response
i did make an appointment with my old therapist on monday but im not sure if i even want to cure my disorderonly the binging aspect of it really it kind of worries me that id rather be thin and sad than fat and happy depressed binging is the worst man sorry to hear that you deal with it too but it does make me feel less alone
there was a somewhat amusing line on tv the other day about how a writer could never commit suicide because theyd keep adding and adding to the note until it became a book then a book series and so on theyd never be satisfied someone else then replied that a literature student couldnt either because theyd be too busy researching and reading everyone elses notes and taking notes on how to write a note although it was all joking and is tired exaggerated i understand the lack of satisfaction thingedit thank you for replying and sorry for rambling on
im not a person to try to keep people alive if they dont want to its your life and yours to do anything with but i still wanted to tell you that there is hope sometimes i was just like you i could have wrote what you did then when i was number im now number and depression free for first time
firstly holy fucking crap this got much more attention than i expected thanks reddit ill try to reply to as many of you as i can
youre only number years old incredible because youre writing comes off so intelligent like an adulti have some things to say to you regarding one of your statementsthese thoughts are so overwhelming and im starting to accept them and i know that if life takes one more thing from me im going to act on them if i dont just act on it randomly one dayif you pay attention you may notice that all of the suicidal inclinations originate within the mind namely from the thoughts have you ever wondered where these thoughts come from these thoughts seem foreign dont they indeed they come to us from our spiritual enemies the demons who hate mankind with perfect malice the demons are able to transmit thoughts to us as if shooting arrows or casting poisonous darts the thoughts are the weapons they use against us the demons compass about us swarming upon us refusing to leave us alone they obtain power over us because to some degree we share in their darknessthey are spiritual parasites who steal energy from us by inciting negative emotions via the transmission of thoughts to the intellect which is a part of the human soul these thoughts incite hatred anger jealousy lust greed all kinds of negativity their ultimate goal is to destroy us when they attack often like piranhas on a feeding frenzy the human heart becomes overwhelmed with despair despondency fear anger resentment and a distraught psychological state that is difficult to escape from and recognizable by its effectswhen these evil thoughts are accepted the thought enters into the heart where it spawns an emotion that is a feeling with which the thought joins and the combination of the negative thought with a negative feeling tends to effect one or two things it will either produce an action or a desireinclination to perform that same actionif you have never followed through with the action then the effect is a desireinclination to perform the action and the action itself is easier to resist however once you begin accepting the thoughts which will assault us repeatedly it becomes increasingly difficult to resist the inclinationdesire to perform the resulting actionits spiritual warfare we must resist the demons when we accept their lies it gives them greater power over us day after day they come to us and inject thoughts into the mind designed to cause despair selfhatred hopelessness etc then they will tell you to kill yourself and they will come and attack you again and again for days weeks months and years they know it will wear a person down if they are relentless they may relent temporarily if it helps their cause if they see us doing things that harm us like using drugs but they are simply lying in wait like wolves if someone begins to believe the lies the demons tell them in their thoughts the demons weaken us and they become stronger feeding off the despair or whatever negative emotionsactions they incite demons seek to conquer a person in small steps if they seek your destruction via suicide they will start small making you feel like an economicacademicsocial failure not good enough ugly unlikable etc things to make us feel bad about ourselves unloved and hopeless among these smaller steps the demons try to get you to start cutting yourself or burning sensation yourself banging your head against the wall punching the wall breaking things once you start hurting yourself following through on the desireaction that is produced by the acceptance of the thought into the heart then it becomes harder and harder to resist the actions they seek and the behavior begins to hard wire itself into the brain where it becomes a behavioral pattern for example if you live in a number story house you can run up and down the stairs tired fast without thinking about it its become a hard wired action another example people who become addicted to smoking can have a streamlined behavior pattern a thought to smoke automatic acceptance of the thought into heart and desire and action are virtually united into a single step person reaches for cigarette and lights it the whole thing becomes a seamless transaction at this point a person can virtually lose the freedom of their will in regard to the action this is also how addictions form within the human personthe problems you are experiencing cannot get better so long as you accept these negative thoughts it is not easy to overcome these thoughts since they dont come from within you thats why many suicidal people think that they cant get better the demons wont leave them alone but instead relentlessly attack the person until the person loses their mind and gives up the fight ending their lifethere is a whole methodology to heal oneself to overcome these dark forces
fine d thanks long time no talk d
while i dont have the same self loathing you have i can definitely empathize with the inability to follow through with my thoughts i once read that george eastman founder of kodak shot himself after a dinner party leaving a note which simply read my work is done here there is a few reasons i dont own any guns chiefly among them is that on a day hyperactive behavior today i know i would be temped to use it on myself i had a botched poisoning attempt in the past i though going to hypersomnia and not waking up would be the answer i figured it would be the most passive way to do what i am otherwise not brave enough to do however the human body is surprisingly resilient there are many days when i consider swerving into oncoming traffic or just aiming for a bridge abutment problem is that i have a pretty nice car and i fear that all the airbags and crumple zones would leave me with some mild damage and a totaled car or even worse paralyzed that is a fate i imagine to be worse than my current life truth be told im fairly smart and it is surprisingly hard to kill yourself or anyone else for that matter without a certain degree of violence to which i am not inclined i try to remind myself that my life doesnt suck i know many men who would consider my life on the surface a considerable upgrade yet i am still unsatisfied i feel hyperactive behavior my entire life is unrequited i feel hyperactive behavior my efforts are never good enough to meet the goals i set forth for myself professionally im an utter failure and cant stay at a job for even number years im quite adept but ive never been promoted and on a couple of occasions have been fired im fairly well endowed which couples with an average amount of charm and the internet allows me to always have a companion but i rarely feel hyperactive behavior they love me for more than my prowess in bed ive even considered at times chopping my girthy appendage off but again the violence that requires prevents me from accomplishing what in my mind is a tidy solution i wouldnt mind being in my body on this earth for number more years but i fear that if it is number hyperactive behavior these these past number or so years have been it is just a waste of everyones time why should a girl fall in love with me i will only let her down why should a company hire me i will only fail their expectations i have so much untapped potential that it seems foolish to waste it by ending my life but then again if there was something worthwhile in there would i really keep circling back to this same conclusion
damn that doesnt help at all yknow that
it does look like you have to get out of that enviroment what are your plans for next year when you turn number
stick around i know it sucks i know what it is hyperactive behavior to go through a ton of shit shit even today i think my life sucks so bad that i should just check out and i am pretty sure i am twice your age number life throws some pretty depressed mood stuff at you sometimes it fucking sucks but you will move on just hyperactive behavior i will and it will make you stronger its okay to be sad and pissed and want to lash out but please dont chest pain yourself because then they win pm me if you need an ear
i hope things get better for you
have you managed to get any help so far with these feelings maybe if you can get some professional advice doctor counselling etc this might help you get by without it feeling like a struggle all the time
i really do hope you help your students all the teachers fucking avoided me because i was socially awkward and didnt know hope to act just make one promise to me and that is no matter how bad a student is or how much they dont appreciate your help then just stay with them i wish i fucking had that rather than abuse i got even if i graduate from something study something i will never have the life i want before you say that i should have other goals of value other things dont bother some of us want to be doctorsengineersteachersathletes just because i want to be rich doesnt mean im selfish we all want to help everyone in the world but sometimes we cant we just focus on helping one person even if that person is ourself i cant be saved helped everyone i trusted doctors ex girlfriend mum couldnt help me so whats the point even though i respect your time to say something and want to help me its time for me to check out early i will be leaving to my destination shortly
wow you have had some awful things happen i think its good you came here though to put it in perspective after reading your post i looked at your karma points number karma so telling your post is long so please forgive mine for being long this isnt a hotline and i know that there isnt much we can say here but some of us can give our opinions and muscle weakness advice here is minethere isnt much i can tell you nothing i can say can make your situation easier and if i were to come on here just to try to make you feel better it probably would be disingenuous what i can say is that i guarantee you arent alone in your type of situation we live in a society that glorifies sex and being a virgin or being unable to have sex is truly heartbreaking when you are absolutely surrounded with graphic images of sex and commercial messages that say that sex is money its absolutely nightmarish what has become of it seems hyperactive behavior everything is about sex and money everything is about pleasure evolution or the justification of one or the other a tree can bud and the flowers bloom but the flowers dont intrinsically reproduce just because you arent reproducing doesnt irritable mood you arent a flower i know that sounds totally gay in the definition of merry cheerful etc disclaimer but its not its religious and spiritual look at nature the genital diseases male beta fish puffs up beautiful and most of them die the peacock has feathers as beautiful as the plant has flowers if you look at nature youll see that a lot of the males in the animal kingdom actually dont reproduce but if you look at the species as a whole youll see that the sections with the most beautiful flowers produce the most fruit you might not be reproducing now you might not ever reproduce i havent and i might not ever but if we were peacocks you and i would still be puffing our feathers and we might still reproduce someday but we are not animals we have endowed to us wisdom strong free will and understanding characteristics that are without a doubt not endowed by nature to other animals youre a human with an amazing story and it touches me some men are not virgins simply for the reason that they didnt want to be virgins anymore but no matter what advice id give i think that its one of the hardest and darkest aspects of modern human life and society to come to terms with but look to history and humanity sex is not the answer if our society could gird our loins for just a bit we could help our brethren in an evolutionary standpoint its about society evolution has helped us as humans become better evolutionary beings you blog a lot you seem awfully sad but i read what you wrote here and read a bit from your blog you seem to be trying to make an awful forceful effort to influence society my friend you have you say your friends are mia but ive read what you wrote here i wish i can have more perspectivesedit from above we are animals that sentence was worded wrong probably but we have traits that make us wildly different from other animals on earth
please dont focus on them focus on all of us who love you from the moment we read your words you are beautiful and worthy and lovable and i can only hope that someday you fully realize this
how often have you made the effort to the two good friends to hang out or do something together most people suck and often times they will not be the ones to call you first text you first or make plans to do something first this doesnt irritable mood they dont want to hang out with you it just means they have lives of their own sometimes i get so busy i lose track of some of the people i have hung out with from time to time and sometimes they lose track of me life can be pretty busy at times just because youre hung up over them not trying to make plans to hang out with you doesnt irritable mood theyre feeling the same way the older you get the more you have to actively try to keep the friends you have lest you risk letting things fade apartas for the female persuasion im going to tell you something i was told from a girl i met at a bar once i was infatuated with a girl and the situation was a little similar unrequited affection i fell in love with her being my super shy self i never told her how i feel to this day because i know how it would turn out she has no clue about thisby not telling this girl how you feel because you know how it will turn out you are taking away her freedom to make that choice at some point you will realize there are only a number of finite options you can make and at no point is it permissible to be madupset at her for any of thesenumber you dont tell her how you feel about hera you find acceptance in yourself for only being a friend to this girl orb you cease being friends with her because it hurts too muchnumber you tell her how you feel about hera she reciprocates your feelings and things progressb she is pushed away by your expression andba you two remain friendsbb you two stop being friendsthere is one thing you know and that is you are not certain how she feels you can make educated guesses you can base your decision off your observations you do not know what this girl will respond because you have not asked her youre not a mind reader so its unfair to assume shes going to answer a certain way and hold it against her for thatleaving this place will not solve all your problems leaving this place will be saying that you refuse to answer them and youre going its hyperactive behavior walking out on a test nothing was solved everything was ventricular dysfunction left blank your life is yours you can make whatever choices you wish but theres a lot of things youll miss on the test of life if you leave it blank too early
well if youre going to drive yourself off the bridge youll never get to where you were going to in the first place metaphorically of course but try to find where that place is
im really sorry you have to go through ache hyperactive behavior that too my ex was my best friend above all else for three years we talked every single day its sounds silly that i was number and he was the first person i could honestly call a friend when we started dating it felt amazing in love with my best friend it was perfect id never been so happy but that all changed in the blink of an eye literally a minute after my first kiss he broke up with me i value your friendship i still want to keep that intact thats what he said five months later and he has stopped talking to me altogether i lost my best friend and my phobia social anxiety mental depression is at an all time drug abuse now just the thought of talking to someone in person freaks me outwhen we were still together he was helping me with my anxiety mental depression issues hed encourage me to take baby steps to make it better but now i dont see the point ill still be alone
its no problem i am actually only here number more week and im pretty free to roam this is more important than anything i do anywayim happy i could help and hyperactive behavior i said ill still be here if you need anything
on another threadtopic here there was the phrase i dont know why i want to liveurl thisurl really dont know where to begin with your racing thoughts problem have you had a diagnosis the fastest ive had thoughts coming it was useful for me and i cant imagine anything faster than that i think if you are having them extremely fast they cant be that useful ive had to use a camera to record myself talking about stuff as it comes to me because im particularly active at the moment so many thoughts come to me every day something like numbernumber writing is the only way i can keep track and building them into something constructive is helpful though the thoughts about the nature of existence trouble me and are nothing i can do much aboutpossibly for you it has something to do with laying down a structure to your day i know mine is unorganized and i feel burnt out a lot of the time as well as depression sometimes i am living in my head all day every day thinking weighing up and analyzing things its not exhausting it feels like the best way to live i actually like not being able to tell what day it is but the problem with that is it also invites anxiety because i dont know where my life is going in the shortterm i always do this trailingoffonatangent thing maybe i should think more and write something coherent but i dont like to wait waste timei wouldnt ever say bad people dont deserve a place in the world rather people are the natural expression of the environment that surroundscreates themim completely isolated from anyone at all i might used to have said i lived and worked for the world nonnationalism but deconstructing all of my identity comes before saying such things there are some things we can say about life however its all well ever have with which to do something of meaning and our creation invites us to have some sort of function in the world whether or not its ultimately pointless or forgettable ultimately it can mean nothing in the bigger picture where were less than number of the universe a grossly immature organization of creatures on a tiny planet harboring egos that seek to undermine our significance but we are not logical creatures people dont usually have these thoughts and that is the rough consensusstandard for sanityi think its more that i dont want itbut there is in all possibility many future places where youd say you do want it so the general therapists task is to get you to enjoy some small things in your life get you enjoying it a little more what kind of person doesnt want to enjoy life and rationalizations towards the opposite of enjoying life will come from not enjoying it i know i have thoughts that conflict at different levels of my existence but even as a thinker it comes down to what i feel like doing in the end its most difficult to do things against what you feel so feeling is key and especially for anxiety a lack of positive associations with bodily or environmental sensationsstimuli is what drives our reactions to it rather than logic so basically i will always have an aversion to people because i was rarely ever hugged as a child and bc i isolated throughout my entire school life but i spend my time on things i enjoy youtube learningreading gamingprogramming a digital life in general the good outweighs the bad and thats how people livei liked thisurl
you are way harder on yourself than she is maybe she is terrible at chess or is missing half an ear and thinks she is ugly but you would still be with her
i might put up one more update stick around
false if you irritable mood something to somebody it means you defiantly are worth it weather its one person or one thousand people you are worth it to them
i think this can be alright ill be mostly guessing things here but please bear with me then you can correct me ok first of all it might be worth going to see a doctor you mentioned the numbers blues but there are some years left to go there some people dont realise that they have depression taking quite a few years to realise whats going on it would be quite annoying to struggle through some more years suffering when you could get help if thats what is needed something to consider anywayive been number and remember it well blues yep worry check actually quite a tricky time even if things are going well number can be the start of major changes maybe a job that pays slightly better maybe meeting someone taking up a new hobby where you can meet someone youve got loads of options at number even travelling if you feel like you need a really major change some people are studying there was a feeling of frustration for me at that point as i wanted to break free and go travelling but felt i couldnt of course i could have actually it was just me subconsciously deciding my prioritiesanyway a few random points there based on me not you but i wonder if our situations arewere that different if anything i can guarantee that i really was number so weve got thatcorrections welcomed please this is just to talk really can you tell me some stuff whats going on with you etc stresses and worries etc therell be someone on here whos made it through something similar successfully probably or if not we can at least listen to you and try to get it
unfortunately for you that door is locked and hopefully remains locked if you are so focused on you being a financial drain why do you not look for other job opportunities so that you can at least contribute towards the rent and be able to say you are doing the best you can do not give up and do not follow in your fathers footsteps
ive lost a lot of motivation over the last few months i really just need a break if i could get over the idea of upcoming bills and put my head down im sure i could get somewhere sadly its never as simple as that
long story short i have a friend i consider one of the closest people to me anyway this friend has another friend friend a and deep down i always knew they loved friend a more than me and that made me incredibly jealous every time i talked to them about it they would deny it and say that they loved us equally anyway recently they ended up admitting that they actually do in fact love friend a more than me and that just left me completely wrecked and i know this is so fucking petty and such a dumb reason to be sad but im crumbling right now
but why is that you have been made to believe in certain facts like you have to achieve something in your life you are a loser if you dont do something productive with your lifebut who says this its been feed to you since you were a small childand btw you should check with a doctor it could be that you have a chemical inbalance that can be a serious problem and might influence the way you think and act check with a doctor please
hey try to slow down i know things seem bad right now but it can get better a lot of peoples lives are a mess mine is a mess although it has been worse for so many reasons but you can put the pieces back together please stop thinking about what you just did and focus on what youre going to do what you want to be things can often seem bad as bad as bad can be but they can all be forgotten i look back at my worst days some times and laugh or prepare to have them again but even if they come they will goi hope youre still okay
thank you so much

thanks so much for taking the time to read and reply to my post there have been a few updates since i made it ive been to a new psychologist and hes recommended a new type of therapy called dialectical behaviour therapy for me i think my main problem is deeper than the circumstances im in i think in fact its caused most of the problems i have i dont really know what i want to be or even who i am my life so far has just been a set of tracks that ive been following and i just chose engineering because it was the next logical step for a successful drug abuse school student i dont know im just a fundamentally broken person right now and at the moment my biggest priority is to quote unquote fix myself i dunno im just a fucked up kid at this point i dont know how to explain it thanks for reaching out though before i made this post i just felt completely useless unimportant i just wanted to have a discussion with someone about well stuff but the outpouring of support was incredible and actually helped way more than anything ive done so far i guess i dont really know what i need but the fact that people whove never even met me are willing to be there to provide whatever they can has really meant a lot sorry i cant really get my thoughts together and thanks for your reply
i can sit here and tell you what you should do but you said it yourself you are the only one holding you back you are number now you are in charge of your life and you will never be alone millions of people around the world feel this hopeless feeling just hyperactive behavior you i know i am one of them its not going to be easy but you can do anything you put your mind too if anything escaping the world you have grown up in should be a blessing not something to fear dont let it destroy and totally take over your life you have so much time on this planet remaining make good use of it make a use of it for you
you are such a brave person for going through all this stay strong number
thanks for the reply i used to be pretty good at finding distractions but lately all i can do is anxiety about everything i have to grow up and get a job start a career move out all the things that functioning adults do every day just give me massive anxiety all the distractions and thoughts all just end at the same place complete hopelessness for future
im in the same boat man if you still feel like talking pm me
im a teen living with parents that control every aspect of my life whats the point of me even living it
it sounds like you have an incredibly negative work environment its incredibly difficult to chose between a wellpaying shit job and the possibility of no moneyyour life is not worth your job i highly suggest looking for other means of income or getting training for a job where you will not be forced to have negative interactions with people all day longspeaking to a therapist or a trusted person parent helps immensely
my teacher had the same advice just sit it out and try to keep yourself entertaineddistracted the wait is just so long
i dont mind either your pick pm is the best if you wish it more confidential
i cant stand it internet hug
i will probably think back to you and the others replying next time because it makes me tearyeyed that strangers would take time out of their day to want to help thank you
hey man im number and apparently a lot of people around this age are pretty unsureunhappyinsecure i guess its this whole transition of responsibilities expectations and crap anyway no real advice im going through a lot of the same stuff i just think itll get better
all i have to say is this taking your life will be the last decision you ever make its not a good one ive dealt with mental depression and suicidal thoughts for several years now and ive also dealt with a close friend committing suicide i believe that this has given me a unique perspective on the subject so let me say this the euphoria youre feeling is not the good kind of happiness instead of accepting that this is the end of your story why dont you change it im not going to tell you to find a hobby or to reach out to friends because obviously youre beyond that mentally right now but the only advice i can give you is this find whatever thing it is that makes you happy not death and explore it learn absolutely everything there is to know about it become an expert on that one thing is it a person that youre interested in become an expert on their life get close to them become friends with them take your relationship with them further etc if its an activity why not make yourself the best you possibly can be at that activityi see youre experiencing sporadic and temporary happiness what if i told you that you can feel that way one hundred percent of the time there are so many methods out there for people hyperactive behavior us theyre simply waiting for you to find themif youre really really serious about this then please do me one favor and just call this number numbernumbernumbernumber its the suicide hotline if you get to that point then dialing that number is the first step on the road to having real happiness again
sport doesnt do it for me either but it works for some and is definitely not a bad thing so thats cool that you go the gym already at least you wont have physical health adding to your worries and it keeps you in a good routineim sure people do like you by the way otherwise they wouldnt talk to you when youre out with your dog if they didnt like you theyd walk away every time dont worry if that happens though once in a while they may be needing alone time not have seen you or somethingi bet you could be friends with the older people actually and that could be good in more than one way are they really quite old i think that some old people are massively lonely sometimes if their children have grown up and moved away etc or theyve lost a partner spending time with the old guysgirls could be worth a shot and although maybe not what youre looking for old people do have younger kids in their families so you could meet an old person then get invited round and meet younger people in the end yes i know how bad this sounds not that old people arent good enough i know this is a bit of a complicated plan but it could work really well old people may have gone through all sorts of stuff in their lives so may be really understanding and a real support for you having said that ive met some really selfrighteous who are old d to start that though you could just ask if theyve got kids i suppose like asking is there anyone else for dog to play with at home then going from thereby the way this might be quite annoying that im trying to fix this but if it helps then i want to try suggesting stuff some plans may be really shitty but if one works out then its worth tryingif you look in google for military wives groups there are some out there you could dtry watch out for scam sites though internet there are definitely people in the same situation there just have to be due to the nature of the military and people being working awaybirthdays yeah i think that out of my few friends not a single one knows when my birthday is unless facebook tells them and i took my date off that recently as a guy and a typical sexist too it seems i dont know theirs either and dont care haha literally lol thats the way for us guys girls are different though in my sexist mind and i can definitely understand you being upset like you said i suppose its a reminder let this be the firstlast year though next year will be sorted out im totally sure you can do this and you can talk to people on here for as long as you like you said youre not best smart talented but i think thats just not true you feel that way now but perhaps its because you may be ill to be honest with depression and loneliness so it could be making you feel that way when youre really not watch out for that one its fucking sneakyplease let us know how things go
agreed even when we are in a good place it is simply an ok day but we still wish to die we wait for the black reaper to come and invite it in without hesitation numbermg of efexorxr currently one thing i do have to say is when my senses go into overdrive it is pretty entertaining being able to hear a nat from rooms away over all the other noise around me
cant believe i had never been told about this thanks random stranger have a great day do you think theyd like my ambulance helicopter
what do you irritable mood by a person you shouldnt love
you can pm me if you like
money at least made me feel like i had friends now i feel alone i cant volunteer i used to but my health wont let me i cry to often to realy be able to go outside or to make a lot of contacts with others i tend to hyperventilate when i am too stress or sad thats why i tried to make internet friends it worked as long as i had money
what about the people you thought cared but evidently dont last night i opened up to a friend of mine who self harmed and was suicidal in the past she just didnt really seem to cate when i mentioned i was suicidal and last night she just asked taking to me because she was anger about something and she said shed text back this morning she still hasnt
i agree that its up to people themselves to make better choices and thats completely impossible when someone is depressed mood because thats exactly what mental depression is its seeing nothing but blackness and despair and not just believing that there is no hope its knowing it there is no point for a depressed mood person to dream of something better in terms of their train of thought what i want to do is help people to see that happiness is not just something to dream of its completely possible to have theres no formula that fits everyone some choose religion some choose love some choose success some choose something else entirely the point is that as i said in reply to another comment happiness is something everyone deserves to have so i will not admit that people should give up and kill themselves suffering is not certain nothing is certain but everything is possiblesorry for rambling just sort of all came out
this place cant cause mental depression if you dont have mental depression it will make you sadif you do have mental depression it may probably will trigger it
my little brother would always watch ratatouille when he came home when he was number my big brother would watch finding nemo twice a day when he was three im really the only one in this house that does not have an emotional attachment to a disney movie hahaedit i just recalled i watched the shit out of walle
if its something you anxiety about or its a problem then its no small we all have different worries something that hurts someone else may irritable mood a minor annoyance to youi have seen people break from to my mind small issues yet others go on with things that would have me huddled in a corner crying my eyes outdifferent things hit us in different ways if its a problem then its a problem i do not see there being a severity in the actual problem more how it affects you sotry to stop worrying it over it being a anxiety number accept it then solutions
i wish i was number again you made a choice back then you have to accept it know cause it is what it is why dont you calm down go for a walk listen to some music rest your thoughts
skype would work my username is robocloud
same position as you and i would love to talk
that must be painful its hard to be loved sometimes sometimes you want to be selfish but i think you are right to persevere i personally suffer mental depression all the time all my life but i believe it will get better and some times im right dont you feel hyperactive behavior you can still be happy still find something to live for and your thoughts of suicide are only thoughts rather than doing it you posted here and you are consciously making an effort to work through it you must believe you can be happy reading your story i believe you can
you could reach out to the guys on the loseit sub about shedding some pounds if being overweight contributes to any issues with low self esteem that could be a place to start thing is youre young your body is still developing you might not be happy with your appearance but i guarantee you will look entirely different in a few years with the bullying that sucks i have no idea how pain that must be but i urge you to report it someone you shouldnt suffer in silence and schools are pretty hot on dealing with bullying these days stay strong i cant promise you things will get better but there are definitely steps you can take to try to improve your situation
you seem as though you dont want to be in college instead of lying about it and causing more debt why not just be honest about it are you drifting apart from your friends because you dont care anymore and you are wrong to assume theyll move on living without someone who is close becomes harder and people just tend to hide it
must have been nice you cant play at all now if you dont mind me asking how did this happen
im glad youre taking steps to get better itll be a long road sometimes its going to feel hyperactive behavior you arent making progress others itll feel hyperactive behavior youre taking steps backwards remember though when that happens it doesnt irritable mood that that the progress you have made didnt happen

the reason i have faith in our species ability to spread and survive is that homo sapiens have surpassed themselves over and over again throughout their existence the species does not stop toiling in its growth for my grand hopes or your bleak existential questioning rather it utilizes these ideas to bolster its rapid acceleration of ability and the scope of its influence i believe humanity it can still be called humanity at that point will do things unimaginable by the likes of you or me as it has a billion times previous colonization of other planets is not so far out of our grasp as to warrant the need to invoke faith i take it almost as fact that we can accomplish something as small as relocation of our speciesterraforming too is something i find small potatoes in the grand scheme of human invention and achievement look at the world around you we have practically covered the surface of our planet with an asphalt mesh of roads we have dammed rivers created lakes and cleared forests soon we may colonize the moon which is little more than a dusty rock ball that happens to have a few icewater caches within its craters i consider theres a chance that our species will ultimately be wiped out just as i consider theres a chance that when i compete i will be destroyed by those better than me that when i leave my house i will get mowed down by a careless vehicle etc however this does not stop me from striving to achieve my goals anyway and i want you to know that ignorance regarding the point of our existence is no excuse for not continuing said existence we may not matter to the universe but as far as i can tell nothing does the only being that cares about my existence is other humans around me i wont exist in number years ill bet but that doesnt mean that there is no meaning to the lifetime i find myself occupying nowfrom what i can gather of you you have a thirst for knowledge i daresay discovering new ideas of the world makes you happyyou say yourself that you would have ended it long ago if not for your endeavors in knowledge i want to ask you have you ever tried living for another person have you recently sought to gain happiness by providing joy to another i myself tired much enjoy gaining scientific knowledge but i find making others happy and the pursuit of flow the state of ones skill level meeting ones challenge the things that make me the most happy i also gain great pleasure from stories relating to the trials of a character and his achievements hopes and failuresi can try to prescribe these activitys for you but if the pursuit of knowledge is truly what can stimulate action from you if it gives you a reason to act and to have goals and to watch yourself achieve them then perhaps you could try to live your life furthering humanitys understanding of the universe you also have a penchant for philosophy which is ultimately the school of thought that your ideas lie in merely borrowing from physics to explain them maybe you could try to find your solution within philosophical textsmy point is that you have a capable brain and i judge you as being far from unimportant both to our species and to myself the universe cannot disagree as unfortunately for it it has no means to our species knowledge of observing our existencei want you to know that i responded to your post because it stimulated my mind and not because i had the need to stop you from dying your existence has meaning with me for a quality you are lucky to possess not just because you are another faceless member of humanity and i have some broad sweeping principle idea that no humans should commit suicide your existence holds meaning with me and with others and so i bid you temporarily excuse its lack of meaning with you and the universeif you commit suicide now it will be too late i already have felt your existence affect my life and because of that your own existence will have a hand in shaping my future existence which will shape the existence of many others inanimate or not you cannot stop yourself from having existed only from continuing to exist you lost the chance to not affect the rest of universe during conception and now you have no choice but to continue affecting it one way or another that said i challenge you to the pointless task of living a full life and going out in a blaze of beautiful glory having positively touched the lives of many others just as you have already touched my own and having achieved a goal that holds a grand measure of importance to you you say that you cannot commit suicide until you are sure that it is the answer and i say that just because you or i cannot know the point of our existence does not mean that there is not one i say that until you experience the the wonder of pure joy resulting from having filled another with joy that until you have achieved something that is important to the unique individual human being that is you that until you have lived a tired fulfilled existence that you cannot accurately judge whether there is a point to it or not at alli leave the rest up to you i have given you my surest reasoning as to the point of continued existence and you have the choice of believing it or denying it and nitpicking at my interpretation in order to fulfill the world view you have previously indicated you have or fear may be true of the universe or you can simply take a small part or two of what i have said and use it to shape a new view i invite you to live gloriously pointlessly and awesomely and this invitation will not expire
yes but if he does walk out on us how will she support us and how will i support her its impossible
i do live with my parents the reason i feel hopeless is because i dont know if im ever going to get on my feet

two is two more than some others have how many single mothers without parents struggle throughi dont think you truly believe that they are the only ones in your life i think you have it in you to know how many caring people there are in the world how many people just hyperactive behavior you looking for a hand to hold with each other were made to move through life together but sometimes hyperactive behavior any pursuit of perfection we begin to reject anything that might fail trust me from an outside perspective when i say your pain fear sad mood might be real but you have so much ventricular dysfunction left for others to enjoy once that cloud has passed and it will pass and you will feel the sun againlosing loved ones chest pain and youve obviously had a lot of chest pain in your life but that doesnt irritable mood that youre not loved or that you wont be very very loved in the future stay safe you deserve it
call this overly simplifying the problem of friends but it is never too late to learn find something you hyperactive behavior doing do it and if you want to be around people who you can get along with get along with you find a way to do it in a group setting if youre interested in jazz find a bunch of venues and try to talk to people hey there by any chance are you in to the jazz scene okay well i was curious if you know about any other shows hey there mr comic book cashier do you know if there are any groups or clubs that meet to talk about latest releasesmr bowlarama dude are there any leagues where i could play with more serious bowlersfriends are people you do things you both hyperactive behavior together some things work better online overanalyzing every new episode of the walking dead or celebrities who just got boob jobs but nobody and nothing is ever too late to have friendsto comment on your age youre being melodramatic youre number now if you died of old age at number thats number years or numbernumber of your life thinking that numbernumber of your time has been wasted or squandered thats really nothing if you lost number minutes out of a half hour tv show number minutes of effective show thats tolerable losses but if you choose to not live you just sat through number minutes of wasted commercials and turned the tv off before you could figure out if the tv show was amazing or an overall waste you know what the first quarter of your life has been but you have no knowledge of what the rest will hold only hunches and guesses
thats what im holding onto im not sure i could handle anything happening to them
i feel like a dick for responding with your broken arm and all but one less person to deal with if i didnt honestly want to help you i wouldnt have commented on your post and im sure your friends do care but they are just trying to avoid the issue because they probably think getting your mind off all this will be better most people think that helps but talking about a situation is what really helps thats why you should really talk about it with someone
i have spent a significant amount of time in beautiful places himalayas oceans villages hills it just doesnt matter or make any difference
i have done that made the noose and stared at it sometimes once you do make it you just feel different like you took a step and suddenly waited for whatever reason i had borderline personality disorder and mental illnesses are a pain in the butt i understand the struggle to have relationships control depression outbursts everything my older brother is also bipolar disorder and yes it can be difficult to understand at times but what i have learned is that until you find the medicine that works for you you cant give up just yet find one that works for you
i do hyperactive behavior hearing others view points on things its probably my favorite thing to observeive never really given any thought to using this to help people ill look into jobs where it would be useful but id much rather do something i have an interest in
that sounds like a really dark place im truly sorry that you have to experience this every day meanwhile everyone else can just go on with their lives and be happy how is it that other people manage to seem so happy anyway i often wonder have you been through any treatments before
i think the book would have a different use for you when you read it it will help you understand the human dynamic how people hyperactive behavior to be spoken to what tools you can use to change how you are perceived dont look at it as a video game strategy guide that will tell you exactly what to do its more hyperactive behavior a users manual
i have had suicidal thoughts in the past and have justified it in my mind the suicidal person doesnt feel bad for the people he is hurting he thinks that maybe now finally he will get the attention he has thought he has always deserved in death i just wanted to clear this up for people who think people who commit suicide are selfish they may or may not be my point is the suicidal person has it justified in their mind
hey know what that is hyperactive behaviorloosing the one you love and allhappy to chat will write something out a little more detailed in a sec
i dont know if youll find this helpful butat number i was dealing with a pretty serious chronic illness and depression and had been since college i had to drop out of school a few times and live at home not working not doing much of anything except feeling like shitim number now and i was able to finish school get a decent job and im in a great relationship im still depressed so i cant promise you thats going to get any better but even if things look hopeless now its not too late to pull yourself out of it honestly i felt exactly the same way when i was your age and the truth is i was absolutely right to be terrified i did what i could and things worked out fine either way its worth attempting to give it another shot it really really isnt too late for you honor that hesitation youre feeling if its what you truly wanted you wouldnt be this afraid really what do you have to lose by going on just a little bit longer suicide is always an option later just put it off for awhile see if things improve
can anyone call an ambulance
people dont understand suicide and arent going to understand your suicide attempt it will just be looked upon as mental asthenia or a moment of madness or some kind of childish gestureyou arent going to make people understand they dont even understand actual suicides and cant imagine why anyone would want to kill themselves i guess this lack of understanding could be a survival mechanism only suicidal people are likely to understand
how about mountain biking get to see nature and a lot less expensive
whatever you do get the fuck out of that school its killing your soul and that is a wound that is tough to heal i went to religious school my whole life was basically indoctrinated told how to think what to believe when to sit stand pray i could go on and on this is the time on your life for you to figure out who you are not who someone else wants you to be tell your parents you love and respect them but you need to do what is right for you try telling them your gay first to soften the blow then say just kidding im not religiouslet us know how it goes
first of all why would you want to do that there are many things worth living for do you have any specific problems do you want to talk about them with the community methere is no easy way to die and even when its easy for you its horrible for other people
i know how you feel about being big im stubby and not the most attractive but i still find myself a little pretty i suppose i have attempted suicide and i used to cut now that i look back on it i regret every second because ill never get that time back if you want to you can pm me number
i hope you have a tired lovely birthday number
that is one way to put it im also illness of being a burden on everyone
the idea of a lifetime scares me i feel hyperactive behavior ive lost myself or never found myself in the first place and i dont know where i would even begin i would even go as far to say that i avoid working towards a better self a large part of me thinks i deserve to be depressed mood and die this way too im bitter i shut myself in my room all day to avoid anything that might make me happy im self destructive and i cant seem to find the drive to be any other way
i try to ignore it when the thought starts that i know is going to cause pain lately ive just started screaming to stop when it starts but it doesnt stop i just want to not exist anymore everyone is telling me to pretty much walk this off you have to motivate myself no one has a fucking clue how hard ive tried gym anything finding any reason to live but i just lose interest and do like ive done with everything else in my life and give up id be dead already if i didnt have to try i cant even pull a trigger and have it end in a split second be done with all this fucked up shit im not going to live like this it either stops or i stop it
i really really hope you get to read thisive read all your comment responses and i feel i sort of get you in a way im number and i had been planning my own suicide for some months until a few weeks ago i sort of postponed it for a long time mainly because of being lazy and not really having the guts to just go ahead and do it when the time came i was so determined i figured nothing would stop me from ceasing to exist but since im still here i think you know i didnt succeed and im glad i didnt after not having any kind of hope or reason to go on living i had even sorted out the guilt of having my parents suffer i reconsidered it all and just didnt do anythingi feel like im not gonna be able to explain myself any further its sort of its some weird shit id really appreciate it if you read my comment pm me if you want to talk you say youd love to talk about your life would you mind telling me about it i wont tell you not to kill yourself if you dont want to just wannna talk
i know how it feels to be depressed but avoiding the chances of things getting better isnt the way to go are you in some kind of therapycounseling i think you would benefit from it but i wouldnt recommend doing it if you wont take it seriously at first i didnt want help either but number years later and i feel so much better feel free to vent more in my inbox or just use to comment
all i can say is hang in there find something you love something that you can take and actually try to make a living with life is all we really have for sure im sure theres someone you know who disagrees with you and would listen to you if you open up to them maybe lay off the booze they dont help ive been down that road all you get is a hangover and you feel worse about yourself the next day drugs don help either they may feel like they do but then you start noticing stuff about yourself when you are high when i was strung out on drugs i was an embarrassment and i failed most of that year of school i lost three months last year to drugs and cant remember what happened my friends just said i made a lot of bad decisions and made a lot of people hate me so just find something about yourself you love think of what hobbies you are into what talents you have what you are really good at and dont say that you arent good at anything because thats bull everybody is good at something its just a matter of how you choose to use it
are there any other places you could see yourself applying your c skillsmaybe i dont really know i havent looked into itim sorry but i dont see the point i already feel hyperactive behavior ive spent too long enduring things i dont want to keep on goingand do you think you may have become competent enough in c to qualify for a programming job somewherei think ive picked up enough knowledge to pass an interview but i suspect itd be difficult to demonstrate competency without having contributed to any actual projects
actually possessing the power to push through and just the presence of it are two different things i dont possess the power nor the will to push through
alrighty well if you want sincere opinions i can give you that but if you dont want sympathy well too bad youre getting that too if not knowing whether your friend killed himself or not is a source of stress i cant imagine why you wouldnt go out of your way to find out the answer if its a source of stress i imagine youd want to do something about it as you seem to be tired answerorientated despite your claim to being lazy is there any other way to contact this person or his parentsi know you dont want sympathy so ill make this part short i dont think any of this is your fault its okay to feel how you feel thats why youre posting here for someone to notice the pain youre going through just know youre not alone i dont think you necessarily have a disorder i think were as im number just at an age where were all really emotional upset or really apathetic in life im too emotional upset i feel everything number if you want to be happy why dont you actively do something about it you say society and people fuck it upwhich to an extent i believe as well but after a certain point you have to say fuck that and take matters into your own weakness of hand societys depressing it truly is people are shitty at times but you cant control society or other people but you can control yourself you can control how you deal with situations and you can control if youre feeling lazy and unmotivated if you want advice i really feel that rewiring how you think will help in psychology cbt is a thing its cognitive behavioral therapy and its based on the belief that if you change a patients thinking pattern and self talk their behavior will change its so easy to give up and if you have that mindset that nothing matters then your actions are going to follow that but if you wake up every morning and slowly change your thought process this sucks i dont want to do this to yes this sucks but if i complete this task it will better my chances of passing this course and graduatingmake me feel better about myself youll start to see a differencei dont know if any of this helped hopefully it did but i tend to ramble
your number you dont know what living is yet that sounds horrible and harsh but its true talk to your parents friends someone you trust get yourself help
thank you spacehorror
ive been thinking about it i might carry on making it at the very least ill see how gamergate goes before i commit to killing myself then ill have a chance to evaluate things
this sounds really tough im so sorry for your loss he sounds like a great guy and i can see why you would be grieving like thisyour child husband and mother are there for you i suppose but its just not something that everyone would properly understand or be able to talk about for a long time the therapist being expensive shouldnt come into it assuming you can afford it you are worth the cost if it helps and they should be professionally trained to talk about thisi cant offer much useful advice as i dont have the experience but theres a rgrieving reddit which may have some helpful people who can understand and help you better not to just send you off packing to there of coursei cant say get well soon etc i dont think it works that way all the same im thinking of you and sending positivity and im sure anyone reading your post will be too even if they dont all post replies
thats sad but i can see how you could feel that way its hyperactive behavior half your team is quitting on you and dumping all their extra emotional baggage for you to carry but you dont need that shit and can carry on stronger by letting it go
do you know anything about whats causing her trouble is it the fact thats you are going through a divorce or could it be something else i suggest you should keep a close eye on her maybe sit with her for a while and show her your support as friends even if you dont mean it although i think you do if youre concerned for her wellbeing from experience id say maybe the biggest thing that leads people to kill themselves is loneliness or perceived lack of support talk to her
heymtgeue is itits difficult isnt iti wish i could be in your shoes take the ache for you and let you experience some of my joy for a second so that without explanation you understood how i overcame my grief anguish turmoils and started realizing what real happiness was or perhaps you would know that there is always somebody out there who understands cares wants you to smile is also afraid needs a hug looks forward to a strangers smile likes you maybe even loves you shy to admit soi know how how everyday feels the sad mood that awaits with every ticking second pummels down on your mood happiness seems hyperactive behavior a farreaching goal that doesnt even render worth the chase anymore depression overcomes you in waves followed by thoughts of parents friends possible moments of life where you are expected to be alive for nothing makes sense other than the cold splash of reality that you are stuck stuck somewhere and you cant see the way out the light at the end of the proverbial tunnel fades leaving you stranded in the dark alone wishing you had a hand to hold onto but he ventricular dysfunction left but i didnt im lost too i need somebodys hand so much i never ventricular dysfunction left the cave im looking for the way out but not just me my friend jose has been here by me my friend diana found the both of us we havent given up take our hand well get out together maybe along the way we can pick up the others yeah nods it hits hard the ache that acts in reverberation through the entire body hurts and it does hit hard sometimes it knocks us down it knocks me down it knocks some of my friends down too yet im here youre here apparently we have something even harder to counter it be it hope maybe for me its people hyperactive behavior you like jose like diana seeing them smile every so often even when theyre frowning number of the time is more than enough to make my body shake with excitement with life with the anticipation that if theyre smiling every so often that means there is something that they still respond to still react to still find enjoyment in still find themselves alive in spirit to move to i remember the verdant green flow that had held my vision for the ten seconds of when i held her hand completely aloof to any other matter of awareness i remember her hand touching mine and the warmth that flowed from her body to mine channeled up to my heart wrapping it and sending it back to the other hand down to the earth we were part of it and when she went the warmth also did and so did the green blue white breezebut and this is a big but mtgueu i remembered after some time seeing the same verdant green speckled with white and purple flowers waving by the breezes whisper i remember the blue clear skies that mapped the entire earth with an embrace warming it to vivid rays i remember it all and the same emotional connection remains intensifies i dont feel her hand anymore i feel the cool grass overlying the soil but i dont miss her hand the warmth returns it comes from the earth itself ushering an entire new warmth i became the connection i became the warmth the earth spoke to me asking me to channel my warmth into it i cannot begin to express how difficult your passage may be there will be moments of severe anxiety there will be those moments where youll stop question yourself and feel sluggish to even try to remember where you were going or what you were doing yet your legs move your heart beats your veins and arteries carry your life force your eyes are still able to capture beauty your hears still hear the laughter of others your face still something people find themselves blushing at your existence becomes needed you are needed youre a variable in this equation called happiness but not just yours others other people need you it may be incredibly selfish but its so important that you smile laugh run dance and give others a reason to do the same they look to youit took me months to recover from my breakup with the only person i ever felt love for it was the longest cruelest three months of my life suicide was a constant contemplation food tasted bitter the very air was pungent even my sisters brilliant smile faded i reached out to this community after two months of frustration and the very first post i received offered a chance to talk imagine thata total stranger offered me his time to talk everything it it was the first time i cried to a complete stranger on the phone ive learned to walk again now im running but not everybody will recover as fast as i did some will recover even faster others will languish for years before they pick up the pace and eventually are back in the marathon everybody wins in our own way i had to find pace of speed in the marathon and i found some people along the way that had the same pace i did what a delight we werent even in a marathon anymore we were just friends on the path of happiness and we happened to be on the same stride youll meet people of all different strides trust me theyre waiting for you to join them so dancelivemake your presence known to the worldcrack a smile or two youre beautiful beyond wordsand as alwaysim

will run with you because as much as you need us we need you just as much if not moreif ever you need im always a pm awayive multiple mediums of conversation lets dance together
hey first off thank you for coming here to talk about it it can be very scary to think of things hyperactive behavior this and easy to feel hyperactive behavior the walls are closing in around you and there is no one else in the room with youi read in your comment that you recently lost a friend i am very sorry for your loss it can be easy to think about death when it visits someone close to you it affects everyone differently so i wouldnt take what the other friend said to heartthe important thing here is that you want to feel different that is something very good feeling different and making those thoughts go away is not something that is likely to happen right away so dont beat up on yourself for not being able to suddenly feel better you experienced a loss and that is a difficult thing to deal withjust try to remember that you are not alone and that you are not a bad person because someone said so in anger it can be difficult not to dwell on things hyperactive behavior this and sometimes trying specifically not to dwell on them can just make you think about it more i have found that the easiest way to stop thinking poorly of yourself is to get busy when your mind is focused on a task it has much less room to think negatively add to that working on a task leads to finishing a task which leads to a feeling of achievement which can also help you to feel better
have you tried to tell her that you feel that shes being mean to you because well it is her job to help you she might not even realize that shes being mean to you if that makes sense if you tell her that sometimes she makes you feel like vermin maybe she will realize that she has done wrong things to youokay is the knife still there with you like i said i really am concerned about your safety and i want to keep talking with you until you dont want to talk anymore or you need to go to sleep and im worried that the knife might get in the way of you staying safe while talking to me i really just want to listen to you and i can hear that you feel that you dont deserve it but i feel that everyone deserves a listening ear when they need it
its ok
im here to chat if you want to
i guess you didnt read if youre just gonna sit here downvoting without even knowing what im about you should just leave man youre not helping
im glad youre still here have fun at the concert
i am sorry about what happened to you you didnt deserve iti know saying not to dwell on what the doctor said probably wont help but he doesnt know you and your actions your past they dont represent who you are and i may only be a few short paragraphs and a username but i will not be happy that youre gone i think you should take a break from your main account it sounds hyperactive behavior youve taken positive from it but now its more negative no one should be told to kill themselves
i also suffer from social anxiety and understand where you are coming from about not leaving the house i only leave my apartment if i am going to work that is it the math thing i would be more than happy to try and work with you if you are wanting help to learn how to love history and can totally teach you whatever you want to know im not going to lie to you because i dont lie just because you have social anxiety struggle with some subjectsconcepts and view yourself as unattractive does not mean you are not still a human being you should keep living never give up
whats the pointwell its not really easy for either of us to answer that question what is the point of life life manifests itself differently for different people it is your journey to take one day you will discover what life means for youthings may or may not get better i cant say i dont really know you but i hyperactive behavior to think that things will get better slowly but surely
itd be wasted on a selfish bastard like me dont hate yourself man no reason for that everyone makes mistakes dont look back to the past the past already happened you cant influence it look at the present moment you feel like you have been selfish in the past ok just try to have better intentions next time trust me itll workif you want to talk im from germany but my english is fairly good just pm me ill listen to you i do care about you
it sounds to me hyperactive behavior you have a lot on your plate and i understand how difficult that can be i can also understand feeling hyperactive behavior you havent accomplished anything yet but you must remember your respiratory distress syndrome adult life has literally only just begun i didnt have my first job until i was number myself as for the problem with relationships you need to realize that even though you were in a relationship with another person who you truly cared for something some people never get to experience you still knew what should be expected of the other person in a relationship i myself suffer from mental depression and major clinical anxiety mental depression attacks the mental depression sucks but the anxiety mental depression is worse when mental depression bouts hit me i only either get exhaustion and unmotivated or a few times a year suicidal but when the anxiety mental depression attacks i get are common in my weekly life that can get even worse my therapist calls it my train as in train of thought ill start with some problem im having and in a split second my mind will follow that train to some highly illogical conclusion for instance i can be having a problem with my friend lets say we have a fight well that friend doesnt hyperactive behavior me anymore they will tell all of our mutual friends im a bad person they will realize i am indeed a horrible person i wont be able to focus on school because of having to anxiety about my friends not liking me anymore ill have to drop out of uni because of bad grades i will have to go live with my mom shell kick me out when she sees im actually just useless ill be homeless ill die of starvation or drug overdose in some backalleyso as you can see these sorts of ordinary problems a person might experience my mind warps it into my friend and i had a fight im going to die homeless in a gutter somewhere when i got on the right path of being able to tell these bad lines of thought from what was actual logical interjection it helped me get past a bit of what was happening in my own life i no longer anxiety about when the next anxiety mental depression attack is going to come because worrying would sometimes set off the attack in the first place as for worrying about feeling hyperactive behavior a drain on your family please trust me when i say that you can bet that your parents wouldnt have helped pay for school for you if they didnt want you to go prove to everyone but mostly to yourself that you will not be made to play the role of the victim the problems we face now are only the problems we are facing now theres no way to logically know what will hold two or three years down the line actively seek out good changes and then they should i say should because nothing changes how unfair life can be lead to better things self improvement is a great way to negate negative feelings dont make yourself better for other people but make yourself a better person just to show yourself that you can amount to something right now you are thinking that you yourself are the worst thing imaginable try and separate that part from the main you critique simple changes into your life hyperactive behavior getting a simple job doing good in school building healthy habits and relationships and set goals for yourself if i had enough space here id tell my entire story if only you would listen short of it is that i came from nothing my father was an abusive drunkdrug user who would always beat my mother my two siblings and myself the first time i tried to kill myself i was number years old i tried to hang myself on the school monkey bars because on top of the other stuff i was always bullied at school for my weight and wouldnt you know it the shoe lace broke as i jumped because i was too fat to even kill myself for being fat now where am i im living my dream at the age of number studying abroad in japan working on my degree in history still never had a meaningful relationship but im working on it through other areas of my life still fat but i dont give a shit what other people think how i should or shouldnt look if i decide to lose weight im going to do so for myself if i want to become a balerina i will life is about taking the punches getting back up and saying is that all you gotif you want to talk at all honestly im on reddit almost every minute of the day just message me and we can talk about whatever you want
ive only really coded one thing i made a pacman game type thing i used javascript i havent done much since
new stars are made all the time whilst old ones burn out sentient life with the ability to travel to and inhabit other planets especially with the ability to terraform them precolonization can manage to survive the appearance of a black hole occurring within its home solar system and in theory survive like this providing it the ability to survive most celestial disasters a universal cataclysm may be enough to take out a species or group of species living in such a manner but we dont know enough about the end of the universe or the possibilities of life experiencing extradimensional travel in order to truly say with any confidence what could happen i find myself perplexed with my ideas surrounding life for if it is designed i use this word in the least literal sense possible to survive cataclysms and disasters and black holes and the impact of other celestial bodies and continue to multiply and diversify and survive i wonder at its purpose surely there is a reason i find myself drawn into some ideas i picked up when reading a short bit of raymond kurzweils the singularity is near i strongly suggest reading that book for a taste of his tired interesting and stimulating ideas on evolution both in the biological world and the inorganic world i should go back to it myself alas i will have to continue this discussion tomorrow like yourself ive had a few drinks tonight and more than my fair share of hoots this afternoon dont lose hope friend and i hope you can find a measure of solace in the knowledge that having a human being like yourself in the gene pool who can actively ponder the philisophical dilemma of humanities ultimate universal fate is evolutionarily genius and nothing but a boon for our species you truly belong in humanity and we are better for your presence
i feel like this too a lot ive been dealing with social awkwardness and ineptitude and loneliness for years ive improved a bit but im so far from where i want to be now im in this weird inbetween stage and that almost makes it worse because i get glimpses into what life could be like what it might be like someday except i dont have it yet and i wonder if i ever willif it makes you feel any better i feel like im getting just a little bit closer to being okay all the time i still feel lonely and awkward and weird a lot but sometimes i look at how far ive come in the past year or five years or since i was little and feel amazed

i read the whole thing your story is fascinating im sorry your life is in such a bad place right now it somewhat reminds me of my school days for a long time i always had the old or secondhand clothes and always wrinkled i didnt really understand ironing clothes while in middle school and my mom somehow allowed me to walk out of the house to go to school every morning looking like a slob one time i really wanted this hooded sweatshirt and i remember my friends mother worked at whatever clothing store it was at my mother bought me the sweatshirt but later returned it because it was number i remember i had this one summer job at a library later on where they didnt pay you until number weeks into the job and then only on a biweekly basis by asthenia three i didnt have enough money for lunch and my parents wouldnt give me any and i tried bringing lunch but someone would always steal it out of a fridge when i was outside working i ended up getting by by borrowing money and buying a plain bagel with nothing on it for lunch every day for about numbernumber fortunately i was able to buy good clothes and make myself presentable by high school you definitely had it worse than me though how old are you maybe you should join the military or go get some dangerous job that no one else wants to do like just go up to alaska if you can somehow get the money and work as a deckhand on a fishing boat or something make sure you go at the right time of the year go become a longhaul truck driver i would tell you to work in the oil fields but i doubt theyre hiring now use the money from the fishing boat to go get your electrician or plumbers license or something like that go get a skill in a job that other people dont want to do become a garbage man for some town garbage men can get decent salary and good benefits if you stick with it long enough or go work in a sewage treatment plant some of that might be union and will be hard to start out in if you want to kill yourself anyway you wont be afraid on that fishing boat when the shit hits the fan and youre in number waves just stick with it man and find something no one else wants to do and youll make it probably you said you were a smart guy

im sorry to hear that american health care sucks sometimes is there any support groups in area there is propably people who know what you are going trough and help deciding what and how you could take steps froward and im glad to listen i have been in situations where i cant figure how to get to better on my own

i may get the odd message on facebook for my birthday but i feel lonely all the same from me to you happy birthday youll have someone special to share your days with soon enough i hope no one deserves a lonely birthday but you will be okay x
ive found talking to people about my problems and sharing them with others ie meeting or talking with people with the same problems i have makes me feel a lot better and its easier to make decisions while calm would you mind telling me about what made you make this decision so you can you know reconsider
hey im here for youpm me and ill talk to you man
how did you feel in those number years i bet it was better than how you feel now you could do something in the place of cutting likesnapping a rubber band against your wrist if you ever need someone to talk to id be more than happy to talk to you dont give up
care to explain what the problem is
hey im number sure youre suffering from derealization disorder i discovered that i had that last year and just knowing what the thing is called helped me out a i dont know if itll help you either but there are a lot of people that suffer from this
always a pleasure
i completely agree with this it took me several different therapists to find one that i could work the best with as well as changing depression medications and dosages to feel better there are a variety of methods out there to help those suffering and it takes effort to find the one that works best for each individual
i know it might seem hopeless but there are certainly other people in their numbers looking to make new friends just hyperactive behavior you you might find people with common interests that hang out with you every night or just someone to talk to about the weather once a week there are a lot of people in the world and i would bet that at least half of them are wanting to make a new friend with someone but youll never find them until you start searching
kind of i havent really changed my decision but you people did change my opinion on life itself a little
healing is a journey not a destination sometimes it feels hyperactive behavior youre making great progress only to get brought down again doesnt irritable mood that the progress that you made didnt happen we learn and grow and adapt from our experiences its okay to feel overwhelmed by everything lord knows i have at several points in my life i know how you feel when you say you feel hyperactive behavior you are only what you can do for or give to other people ive had a hard time with this but ive made it a point to cut those types of people out of my life ive come to the conclusion that there are two types of love the type where people love you because they need you and the type where they need you because they love you its the former that you want to avoid take some time for yourself be gentle and understanding and lenient with yourself healing is a long hard road that we have to walk youre not crazy youre not broken youre not a burden youre a person and you deserve the same type of care and love that everyone does
even though im sure i cant even grasp what it is to feel like this right now i want to let you know i support you you have every right to feel this way towards your family and they shouldnt have treated you this way youve been completely fair to you parents and your sister you seem like a reasonable great guygirl and i think you deserved to be treated as suchim here if you want to talk so pm me if you feel like it
i feel exactly the same way as youve described here the hate and resentment i feel have become so unbearable however i really wish i could live i really wanted to live tired long but unless i find a way to get as far away as possible from humans by the time number years have passed then i will have to kill myself so please you who seems to understand this please talk with me
you can do it believe in yourself youre so much more than you think you are i wish you luck strength and courage in life
depends what the reason is im only an ear and a brain to you you can tell me
i dont even know where to begin i dont even know if i want to begin fact is im in a frustrating place everyone keeps being bitchy to me around the house they have no respect for me and all i did was just prove why
im going to try to save you now im in a similair situation trust me i know how you feel this girl is so lucky to have somebody that cares so much about her can you tell me something about yourself
youre on the phone are you okay
i can sympathise mmpoint by point bed is awesome and warm and cosy if you pay for uni maybe you should pack it in at least until you know what you want to do later you have a whole life to make mistakes in yes this a million times fucking catch number situation right cant meet people who would suit because of not meeting people i dont know what to say about this it sucks being on edge how do people do it not pathetic well not as pathetic as you think its a horrible distortion to feel this way i know that feel oh god yup know that feel not knowing where to direct the anger is awful right i smoke that is supposedly selfharming likewise it feels good hell even getting short of breath and rarely aches in my ribs feels hyperactive behavior something so whilst i cant fully understand this habit that is where i am coming fromhopefully you can tell i am sympathising with you i wont know your life but there is a bit of info on me no judgementall i can say is help isnt all professionals but they are the most experienced at it if they are callous and turn you away or dismiss your situation sorry but they are paid but not pro i dont know if it helps but not being alone in understanding that although not standard you are not absurdly out of touch people need to deal with it a doctor will have to take you seriously eventually if they dont you are in every right to get anger if they are continually neglecting their oath to do no harmi cant say everyone finds it this hard i hear not thinking about it helps that being easier said than done of course you may not need help but noone here can truly know enough to pass that judgment the question isdo you think you need help it comes down to that really the rest is getting it
hey theres a reason you have heard the wait and eventually you will move out because it seems to be the safest option alternatively you can contact child protection services or someone at your school like a principal or guidance counsellor you have two other siblings do the right thing if you fear your safety then this might not be the best option but its all you got its one shot killing yourself will just end everything i dont know if you believe in afterlife but i would bet my chips on it even if you dont decide to talk about your parents please please please see a counsellor its important that you receive the support you need if you have any questions pm me
what kind of guidance are you looking for
from what i know there are clicks and groups of the sorts that find their own identity you have the flamboyant the average and the well hidden types i dont know where you live nor should i but with a couple quick google searches i found a handful of websites that organise these types of events in texas just an idea stay strong
it has been number years since i lost my job i have tried my bestthe things i lost in my life i believe them to be extremely fundamental and important things i also lost a life that had little worry and stress now i have a job that gets worse every day doesnt allow me time to exercise is in a boiling hot city that saps me of energy has horrible bitchy colleagues and so on this is the norm i have come to realize
most genuine problems i have seen since coming on this site all a person has is what is happening right now thanks for saying this
intelligence isnt the only trait on which you can build a relationship it was just an example from my own life and how i thought i knew that i hated the world just meant that i hated or eventually would come to hate almost everyone but number or probably even something closer to numbernumber of people
is nobody reading what i said you say that sharing of love is the greatest gift there is my girlfriend and i are extremely young but we love each other it is a fact it physically hurts being away from her she has said the same to me that said i think there is no point to love no matter how happy it makes us it is chemicals in our brain put there for the sole purpose to make us want to have sex and reproduce to further our species that is the only use of love and the only reason it exists
youre stronger than this feeling this way is normal when things like this happen its normal to have a period of mourning if you ride it out i promise things will get better
it is nice that you are trying but some people are just here to suffer and die your friend may be one of those people where no amount of therapy or pills or ect will ever helpmy advice wpuld be to take your friend bowling or to a rope swing or some kind of physical activity maybe a roller coaster it may provide some minutes or moments of relief talking or watching tv does not do that
i give a fuck
youve had a lot of relationships bud maybe you should spend some more time with yourself take a walk outside and see how you can manage inside your own headstarting over sounds good hell it sounds good for me toojust go outside and sit in an obscure cafe and stare at a table or drink something you dont need to think about anything in particular just dont try to solve any problems in your headwalk somewhere else and pay attention to whats around you i do this sometimes and it feels nice to see the leaves and the people and the animals and the buildings i sometimes forget theyre there when im thinking about other stuffspend some time with yourself before you look to other people for help if you are able to handle you and your mind in the same room i think you can be able to manage mainly because a lot of people have the opposite problem which is that they have a hard time getting to know and getting along with people i think im kind of in between but everybody struggles with somethinghang in there bud and take a breather by yourself out in the fresh air
what are you going through how could you end your life when you have so much to offer think about your many interests you havent even explored them yet you have many duties and drinking bleach will only be a blight on your obituary your obituary is yet to be written you have no limits dont waste your life away
youll find deep down most people without a specific goal feel this way find a goal to work towards or start making art
its already done my friend whos going to miss another fat wisconsin kid no one im alone
how are you feeling today
do you know if your school has a counseling center ive been having similar problems this semester and the counseling center is helping me a lot im talking to someone there who is great with both helping me with my problems in their own right and in explaining my situation to and helping me work things out with my professors
im not much of an expert first time posting here but id say that you should identify the things that make you the happiest and focus on those for awhile maybe focus on your daughter also have you considered talking to a professional about your problems with large groupslike i said im no professional but i used to have the same sort of problem with large amounts of people what worked for me was to try and focus on learning more about the specific people youre with theres bound to be someone youre interested in in any group of peoplealso you should talk to your girlfriend about this too it may feel shameful for you to discuss your concerns and problems with her but this should not be the case i really hope this helps at least a little and if you ever want someone to vent to the rest of the subreddit and i are hereas someone who has experienced a close suicide all i ask is that you consider the effect your death will have on others what will happen to your daughter your struggle doesnt have to be invisible anymore
call number right now then throw up there will be other girls trust me
trying to talk to my friend hes drunk at another friends and has no transportation what frustrates me the most is he said to call i needed him and when i did he asked it i was sure if i needed him
it has been an hour i hope youre calm now and arent regretting your decision and i hope that if you do have any doubts you have the courage and time to ask for help from a medical professionaleither way im glad we got a chance to have a chat albeit a brief onegoodnight rthisisntjimmy
this thread made me come up with the analogy between me or even suicidal thoughts in general and the number stages of grief im in the stage of denial and stating or knowing that i am does not change the stage i am in i still do not want to accept the reality that there is a part of me that thinks dying is a great solution to a problem i cannot see or rationally find i want to kill that part of my personhood off what am i suffering from why am i suffering my suicidal thoughts are just a ache in the ass and im denying my entire personhood self and feelings as a result i am killing my identity replacing it with one where i am emotionless and nothing but my ideas and reason will constitute me again similar to how my reason is contradictory with my feelings this acknowledgement of both my identity which i want to kill and the stage of denial are contradictory too its fucked up
how did you even go about forcing yourself to do such small tasks my schedule is beyond fucked up with on average a numbernumber hour daytoday difference in the time i go in and out of bed dinner often becomes breakfast and breakfast becomes dinner im thirstyhungry as fuck right now but i cant get myself to get out of bed and drinkeat something im skinny as fuck i stopped making my bed in which i spend number hours of my day and just hypersomnia under and on some sheets instead i had a bike worth number dollars in the city i study which i lostgot taken by the city because i couldnt comply with the law that stated that bikes must be used every number weeks i have subscriptions and contributions worth number dollars a month still running but are unused because i cant get myself to post the letter to cancel the membership
its crazy how much we need that well i have no family foster child both parents passed i recently got out of an eight year relationship and lost all my friends in the process i have no money i look around the world and feel like it could be a lot worse but really there is nobody in the world that loves me i actually count days where i go without speaking to anyone i dunno anymore enough about me although my name is jenny and i live southern california you
it also sounds to me hyperactive behavior maybe your just taking on so much at once that your suffocating yourself to death though i have my fair reasons why i wouldnt mind the afterlife over this one but they usually never mix with why i would actually prefer to go then stay i just want to hypersomnia all the time hyperactive behavior you said and to me thats the closest thing to actually being gone maybe our problems is we want an escape from reality even if that escape is a one way trip to who knows where sleeping however is a good substitute but honestly and this could just be me how long till you just cant bare reality any longer maybe this isnt the life we wanted and are just sad we arent going to live a dream we so hoped for yknow idk
i cant i just cant i am not a valuable human being and i know it
take a giant deep breath as slowly as possible once your lungs are totally full and you can feel them stretch hold for number seconds and let it burn breathe out as sloooow as possible when your lungs are depersonalization push out that last little bit of air and hold your lungs depersonalization for ten secondsrepeat three times please
lets say i find one of these points to life lets say i do every single one of the things you mention it still wouldnt matter if i saved someones life by my logic there life is pointless as well so by my logic it wouldnt matter if they live or die im not suicidal anymore but my thinking is still like this thank you for taking the time to write this out though
you can talk to me any time
thats a really good advice reminds me ive got a list with a billion movies on it that i still want to see haha
youre still young and you will have many more relationship opportunities try not to be too discouraged because of this one unfortunate experience or any others you might have had the important thing in relationships is to always communicate what you want and make them communicate what they want if you are friends with benefits with someone and you havent talked to each other about your expectations of where things are headed then dont be too surprised if the relationship never develops beyond that some people only want sex and they will find it without ever committing to anything or even while deceiving their partner its something to be aware of ultimately you will need to develop trust with your partner while addressing both of your needs yours come first though
well at least you dont seem suicidal except for that catastrophic dead end at the end of your post about gassing yourself id say do something daring it seems like youre the kind of guy who has nothing to loose at this point but are unwilling to due to laziness i think you might want to take a break from your gf due to financial reasons since both of you are at your limits dont let the world get to you though there are plenty of places to work at as the poster above said as a truck driver i wish i could offer you more advice but try and look at your present situation in some positive light as hard as that sounds since youre posting here i mean you literally have nothing to loose other than your own life if you decide its pointless which it is not hope the best to you brotha and keep on fighting
pretty soon youll be an respiratory distress syndrome adult and youll have a lot more control over your life things will improve
its difficult to know whats normal when one only has their one frame of reference it took me a long time to realise that frequent thoughts of suicide are not normal i used to think that everyone had them when they felt down they dont as to how you go about explaining it you already have just repeat what youve said here and theyll expand on the rest
maybe it was a stupid way of me talking about this stuff the universe doing things i irritable mood because i dont actually believe in a sentient universe or god or anything hyperactive behavior that anyway i think most people dont understand just how hard it is to make it in life if you dont fit into this very small box of what is normal if you dont have a family and education and a healthy mind and body and a job that pays enoughall these things its just really hard there are people who overcome but there are a lot who just cant the only reason im still around is basically my dad who has been a solid rock all my life if he wasnt around hell im not sure what id do what is the thing you wanted to learn that you posted about above
no money no insurance social services here suck
dude if you dont die you should totally get yourself to the us or australia or new zealand you wont starve to death and women will be iterested in you as soon as you talk to them because of your accent a scottish lad would do great in new york city you would have to have roomates but you are young and could start a whole new life
long distance is a tough thing man i know first hand has she given reasons why she is doubting the relationship or failing to see a future what is it that makes her feel that way cause it certainly isnt anything you are doing
heyhave you considered joining any clubs or doing any volunteer work working at something hyperactive behavior an animal shelter soup kitchen or food pantry can be a great way to meet new people and make some new friends
times like these make me almost numberx more suicidal thanks ill keep in mind that i can talk to you
number here pm me please had a relationship that went south after she moved to england
i know what you mean i think about blowing my brains out frequently i just think about the immensely sweet relief that ill feel when my constant anxiety and fear no longer exist all of my issues will disappear and thats all that matters why is suicide bad again if i am in a certain position in life that is horrific then why should i continue i am a chemically normal person that fear i mentioned above is a result of my bad decisions i will soon lose my freedom one way or another
op the fact that you wrote this is a cry for help it shows that you dont actually want to do what you are talking about doing talk to someone your life is fixable there are lots of resources and things for people that have gone through what you have
if someone thinks youre a burden to them then its not worth continuing to seek a close relationship with them
you are a lovely human being
same here you can pm if you want
hey man i dont know if this helps at all but i think you should try to focus on what makes you happy and put your efforts toward that what do you hyperactive behavior to do ive been through mental depression myself and what worked for me was to completely relaunch myself with different friends ones im happy with whatever it is thats bothering you you just need to focus on it and make it better if you cant do it alone thats totally normal and thats why this subreddit is here keep up posted
thank you my work has been awful i promise im trying to be positive but i keep getting knocked down my boss embarrassed me in a meeting on friday i wanted to just walk out but i need to be level headed and responsible i keep writing about everything and hope that will somehow help maybe it will coming on here helps i hyperactive behavior having the support even if its just from strangers thank you
i reddit even if you steal your buddies gun and go out into the woods someone is going to find the body eventuallythis is what i see from your post there is a party going on but instead of connecting with people you are alone thinking of killing yourself because you dont connect with people kind of a conundrumso youre a smart guy maybe things have always been easy for you in life making friends is not always easy dont crying reflex abnormal about it if you dont get what you want no one has to give it to you if you arent making new friends at the party try a new circle of friends and start overi dont know what you look hyperactive behavior anything else about you but try putting effort into your appearance and hygiene when meeting new people dont talk about depressing shit hyperactive behavior this it can put people off then go out and do something social even if you dont hyperactive behavior it be in a joyful state about how much you hate it you dont have to do it again but you really just need to try
youve been trying thats what matters you dont have to be sorry for still being here youre reaching out for help and thats telling us that you still have the will to live
your most prominent thought might be how will i ever find another like her that is the most poisonous of thoughts i know you thought she was perfect and i know you thought that youll never get another like her but you will dont worry
doing it for myself seems pointlessdont do it for yourself then and certainly dont regard human life as a game almost as if theres a single wayprocess to win it seeing yourself as a resource hungry animal is not a correct way to think it isnt healthy either being able to form sentences like you did in your post means you have tremendous value that value translates extremely plainly into the real world if you can form sentences then there is no doubt that you have mental faculties that can analyze plan and decipher information in a meaningful way there are billions of humans who are struggling to survive turn your waste of a human self into a person whose mere existence transcends borders nationalities and prejudices help others you will in turn help yourself my giving yourself an unprecedented amount of worth
let me ask you somehting do you know what its like to be so lonely it hurts
im sorry you were quite vague so i dont really know how to appropriately respond what i can say is that numberway love is not love i can also say that women prefer men that have been in prior relationships its an attractive quality the majority of the time my point is you probably wouldnt be alone or unloved for very long if youre wife is really going to move on then you are certainly just as capable life is all together to short most good guys will always love the mother of their children my point is if you love her then you should want for her to be happy as the father of her children she should want the same move on im sorry if thats too blunt or bordering on tough love but if your relationship isnt salvageable and one of you isnt interested in making it work and fixing the broken wagon wheel theres really nothing else for you to do then is thereim not going to disclose my life to you but i will say this and i might get in trouble for it if this was a lawless world id save you the trouble and assume your identity sorry if thats a bit callous you have far far too much to just flush it down the crapper maybe if you never had a wife never had kids never attained financial stability and security never had a home never this and never that but you do you have all those things and you can have that number thing again maybe even better with someone willing to work on the relationship because you are worth it to themagain i apologize if i came across as insensitive i understand this temp life change is getting you down its definitely a big one but all i see is happiness in your future its difficult talking about this without upsetting someone or stepping over the line i cant wrap my brain around why you want to die you sound hyperactive behavior a winning tiger blooded adonis of society is it to spite or chest pain her for leaving youyou say youre too in love you are choosing not to move on not to move on now is that what you would choose numbernumber years from now id say taking time to yourself and not moving on is the healthy thing to do id think something was wrong with you if you replaced your wife within a month taking time to collect yourself is normal and healthy the hopeful in me does wish you could sit down with your wife and work it out does she know how much you love her do you tell her or show her with romantic feats have you guys considered relationship counseling if she is willing to work then work man if shes cheating on you then how could you love her so much still well anyway id wish you the best of luck but i genuinely believe that if you dont kill yourself you probably wont need my good wishes i know the old other fish in the sea adage is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to hear but you sir are a god darn marlin dont think of it as the end think of it as the beginning of something potentially better thats what it can be if you let iti change my mind i will wish you good luck i dont care if you dont need it youll fall through the ringer of a broken heart itll be hard but youll come out the other end stronger and better its the start of a new year
thats alright youve still got the most massive collection of human history knowledge and news sitting right in front of you its actually daunting to try and find something to do on ittheres all the stuff i mentioned before but theres also forums for any hobby or interest you can think of collections of art interactive things etcoutside of that you probably have pen and paper writingdrawing can be incredibly helpful
my views on depression are not as based to biology as yours are but i too agree that life can only trigger underlying issues but i also believe that you need some kind of trigger for every psychological problem
it is your decision but if you think no one cares you are wrong because i care and so does everyone else who has posted sleep on it just take your time to reconsider
hovering on the invisible border between life and death makes you weary i havent been online much in fact i keep doing things i dont want to do anymore because its all i know

hey man im here to listen if you ever want to talk there is nothing wrong with taking a medication or talking about what is bothering you in order to function normally
are you in the us or from somewhere elsei know in the uk we have a lot of money advice services and if it is loan repayments then in special circumstances they can reduce the debts barely a few dollars per month killing yourself to get your mother out a financial hotspot is a terrible answer to it and that isnt meant to sound harsh to you because i know youre trying to do all you can for her however would she want your death on her conscience all because of moneyplease do post some more about the situation and i will see what advice i can offer you did the right thing in posting here
you arent alone you know you can always come on here anytime and either myself or someone else would be here to listen and help in anyway we can i have been in the situation myself and still currently am firstly for the money problems have you spoken to any debt management companies or to your providers directly they usually can set up minimum payment plans if you are in financial difficulty it might not seem to work but as soon as you open up the lines of communication with them it does help secondly if the so is no longer living with you could you possibly get in another lodger to help with the current bills it could also help give you some distractions if it is a nice housemate just makes sure to get contracts thirdly if you are really struggling at the moment have you spoken to your local gp or doctor about it they can always offer short term or long term therapy or some medication just to help you through these rough patches you arent alone in this suffering shawshenk i am in a similar situation myself and the thing i have found that brings me a tiny bit of happiness is being able to give some of the advice i cant give myself to other people you need to find something that gives you a feeling of achieving something instead of focusing on the negatives i know you can do it
my parents already know i smoke weed i smoked with my mom a few weeks ago which is what the text was about im afraid hell bring it up if she tries to helpour small group of friends has been working to help him out of this situation so they already know about it theyre kind of looking towards me as being the leader do i need to come up with a solution that works for both parties the counselors at my school are absolute shit so i wont be talking to them if i can get a therapist i think that would help a lot but im afraid to confront my parents about it but i think that the best way to help my friends situation would be to call his stepmother while his father is away to ask to have a sit down with his dad from what ive heard she might be somewhat on our side i feel hyperactive behavior i really need to remedy this situation because its causing me so much stress and driving me towards suicide if youd hyperactive behavior to know more about the situation let me know
youre not being a bitch and you dont have to charm anyone youre depression and you may just want someone to listen to you theres nothing you have to apologize for ill listen if you feel like talking

i know what you mean but realize thisyour perspective on life is defined by the things you have been told and by the way you thinkhere are two quotes from the buddha a person not a god who was able to transform his mindxenumberxnumberxnumbercwe are shaped by our thoughts we become what we think when the mind is pure joy follows like a shadow that never leavesxenumberxnumberxnumberdandxenumberxnumberxnumbercyou yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affectionxenumberxnumberxnumberdim pretty sure meditation might do you good i have done it for several years please contact me for details dont worry im not religous meditation has nothing to do with the religion buddhism its exploring ones mind this exploring might help you find out what it is you need to be happy and not what you have been told what happiness is supposed to be
first of all gay totally not a sin that is shit invented by others to control and make them feel bad about themselves figure out you and what makes you happy fuck what others tell you sex is or what it should be about you do have emotions they are likely repressed cause you are deal with the above and i think it will open up all kinds of doors weight is fixable you want to drop some weight you can do it and skin and other problems you can have it covered in a lot of places if it causes other medical problems you might even find a doctor willing to do things for you free of charge change is possible if you want it bad enough sounds like you need to find out what you want to do with life once you figure that out work isnt work i will give you some blunt truth about meds they do work and lots of people think that once they work they dont need them but there is no shame of that there are tons of meds on the market there is a combo that works for you but you have to work with the doc to find that combo which includes possible lifestyle changes etc again sins are written by morons fyi mccandless which is the guy from into the wild aka the real person there was no painless death he starved to death from his own stupidity nothing about that is romantic or smart also no painless way to kill yourself that is the absolute truth even pills can do a lot of damage and pain before they kill you thats if they kill you most people pass out and vomiting in their sleep
there is nothing else to share nothing can change now no matter what i share or what people tell me my life will be the same i guess you could say its time i check out a bit early
forgive me if i misunderstood you posted saying that if noone was with you on valentines youd kill yourself in one light thats compelling people to act on a wish to prevent harm to yourself but its also a tired narrowlydefined criterion rather than a general plea for help with whats presumably a bigger issue at play we want to understand and we want to help
the thing is that i dont see myself in the future no wife no house no car no decent job nothing every single day i spend hating myself at work or playing with pc at home i just sit and wait for the time to pass by im not going to kill myself today or tomorrow probably around middle of next week but the chances are i will chicken out and cry going to sleep now
greetings other other me
well first and foremost you are absolutely doing the right thing by posting this consider this you obviously care about him and clearly want to help him get better you seem to mostly just be torn on how to best help him in my humble opinion i would probably go and tell his parents because it will probably be easier to get him help than for you to do it im here to talk for a bit if youd hyperactive behavior to pm me but until then think of this if youre worried about him being anger ifwhen you tell his parents its infinitely better to have an anger friend than having the possibility of losing one
funnily enough having goals were what was causing the depression last time around i got rid of it by giving up on all the goals and dreams i had mostly by convincing myself they were all unachievable no matter what i did
what if the person knows i have bipolar
yes ive struggled a lot with depression in the past and i feel a lot better now i hope you feel better
there will be other girls they will all be better than this oneyou are not alone we are listeningyou arent going to be this sad again youre young that sounds flippant and im sorry the fact of the matter is that biologically speaking your bloodstream is being hammered by so many different hormones that half of the moods you feel dont have anything to do with you at allit will get much better trust me and someday soon you will be able to use this pain you feel right now to reach out to someone else someone who is feeling what you can only rememberhang in there bud take it from me the pain youre in is giving you a far greater ability to appreciate joy than those whose lives have been easy
hey man excuse my bad english im from germanybut id hyperactive behavior to tell you again that you really should not kill yourself im number years old and i tried to hang me up but i didnt make it because i fell in panic attacks this was my last try and i talked to some people and changed the way i life got some order into my stuffgot some stuff to do etc and now i feel stronger than before i got depressed mood just tell me and i will listen to you and do my best to support you in this situation

i looked at your post history and it seems youre a marijuana user wont you miss that then again that could simply be what is helping you copein my mind there are two types of suicide reactionary suicide and clinical suicide the latter exclusively involves a mental illness such as depression while reactionary suicide can involve a mental illness but it also involves the happening of some tragic events which describes you
it is time to take responsibilitywe all make mistakes so what this is an experience i hope you learn from but you need to understand that you can have a life beyond a degree from collegemy first advice to you in order to get your life back on track and pay off whatever money you have to anxiety about is look at the trucking industry canada has a booming trucking industry right now and are always looking for new driversthey will teach you they will pay for it you were going to them for a few years and you pay off your bills and make a little money on the sidewhen your life the straightened up a little bit try different approachbut there is no need to kill yourself over stupid mistakethere are alternatives the college and obviously youre going to have to go down that roadbut its a safe road killing yourself makes no sense the next number to number years ago be really successful trying something differentcollege helps but its not always necessary time for plan b them trucking youll be able to travel around canada you might find a new place you might want to settle downbut suicide is more stupid than dropping out of college student of a mistake people will forget about the college incident people never forget about you killing yourselflook at options not solutions to fix a temporary situationtake care
im exactly where you are now numberyo male the person i loved doesnt even care how her words and actions pain me i come from a tired disfunctional family and i just want to opt out feel like a coward for only thinking about it going to be in a university in a few months the worst part is i dont know how to help you i feel pathetic im illness i can pray to the universe to take care of you love you from a thousand miles away but dont know any real way to help you
i dont know i never know what i want to talk about when im like this my mind is blank always blank nothing i think about how it would be nice to talk about anything and have them only respond positively and never judge me i cant afford therapists i hate being this way because im deaf and blind and its nearly impossible to be i a social situationlike today i learned thata good friend of mine at work is leaving for another job i would have known this by overhearing conversationsshe never told me and full well aware that i cant hear well to overheat conversations naturallythis happened an hour after my bf basically saying that my attitude of apathy made him think again that i dint want to be with him thing is i dont know if i want to be with himi never really know what i want because im apathetic number of the time the other times is when i read books solving problems in coding and rich climbing all nothing to do with socializing and i want friends
what makes you think youre evil

if you dont care about them then start enjoying your life there is nothing bad about being bisexual you are whoever you are im not giving up on you tell me a bit about yourself
i basically have never believed in anything except for the time i previously mentioned and that went away when i lost my connection to happiness and life in conjunction with my becoming more of a realist and understanding the way the world really works better as for how long i tried to take meds about a year at first they seemed to help except caused erectile dysfunction but that really plateaued after a few months and after a year i decided the erectile dysfunction wasnt worth the nothing i was getting out of taking them unfortunately the psychological side of the erectile dysfunction has still lingered and is often a problem its been over a year since i stopped taking them so its not like this decision to take my life is coming as a direct result of stopping i am just tired of failing ive been trying different strategies to get back on my oedema of extremity for number or number years now how long do you try and continue to get sicker and sadder before it is clear that it is just too latepeople die after being miserable and alone for decades i dont want to be one of them
okay ill check up on you every so often and feel free to message multiple sclerosis about anything
wow thank you very much hello indeed fellow welshie _
adderall completely alleviates my social anxiety and makes me feel like a normal person with a full spectrum of emotions heavily weighted towards the good ones taking adderall allowed me to understand what life is like without depression i went to two doctors and asked if i could get a prescription for it to treat my depression they both gave me a flat no i took a test to see if i had adhd i didnt this all happened a few years ago i no longer have access to adderall i stopped trying to go to doctors because the ones i went to were mean and it was an embarrassing experience no one will give you adderall for depression but many kids get adderall just by seeing a doctor complaining about attention problems and taking a test it is supposedly not that hardi dont know why it isnt prescribed for depression it may have to do with the medical community believing it would only be a short term fix and you would eventually build a tolerance and start abusing it and other amphetamines i feel that if doctors feel comfortable prescribing it to kids with adhd then they probably arent that worried about this kind of abuse everyone knows it is a popular recreational pill i think doctors should either accept that reality while trying to help people with mental disorders or disallow it entirely i never tried it long enough or consistently enough to determine if it could have been a viable longterm solution for me i dont know if any studies have been done with amphetamine salts and depression another reason i think it probably isnt prescribed for depression is that doctors have access to a lot of different kinds of antidepressants that are proven to be effective for many people and are almost universally safer and less abuseable than adderall i never found an antidepressant that helped me and i stopped trying a long time ago but thats just me i dont have the motivation to see doctors anymoretldr tell a doctor you are worried you might have adhd using more subtle words
i see what you are saying but its so hard to do it i feel lost and abandoned i havent had the best past and a lot of bad things led to my depression if he was to come back i would welcome him with open arms but i dont see it happening its hard to open up to them when i get hyperactive behavior this the friend who found me about to kill myself last time is the only one who saw me this way i cant seem to even pick up my knife or even open a pill bottle because every time i do i think of her she loves me and i love her its making me feel so much worse because im so ready i dont want to feel this way any more i cant stop crying ive been crying all day i feel so stupid for being this way but i cant seem to stop it im sorry im probably typing too much
beautiful thank you
but right now it just seems so pointless because everything i had to live for is gone now i irritable mood right now i am so happy that people even if they dont know me care about me because the only person who cared about me no matter what is now gone my life is tumbling down right now and i dont know another problem comes with without being boasty i am a pretty intelligent person with that comes that my brain is very active that brings it creativity up and thinking about her having an other man this drives everything even more downi am still hesitating with that gun i mwan i threw away the ammo but its easy to get
thank you to be honest i am worried and overwhelmed as always theres so much i need to do right now there so many things i want to do but if i push myself too far i end up in a nervous breakdown my anxiety mental depression is eating me from the inside out
i would never wish muchless wish someone to take my burdens i just wanted you to know you arent alone
i can relate at least when im depressed mood i feel something that doesnt feel completely fake im sober too number months it only seems to get harder
what decision pulled you towards cambridge then as a boardingschool and why do you not plan on staying in helsinki is it to do with your girlfriend
i cant do that for you i dont know you i could help brainstorm and get you started flowers witness all the sunsets love stories you read shows you watch helping someone who isnt as fortunate as youbasicallycreate a new sense of purpose in lifewhatever that purpose is living for the new sunset and new sunrise living for the unfortunate people living for love or even living fori dont knowthe beautiful grass in your backyard that decorates your garden gnome just sowhile you are finding that purpose you can also find someone to air out your thoughts and feelings even if its a stranger it doesnt matter if all the emotions you have is apathy how you dont care about the politics of the world how you dont care about your grades how you dont care about your performance at work doesnt matter how pointless or empty put all of your thoughts on as many subjects as you can out of your mind and into the open whether it be here or with someone irl
is there anyone you can talk to do you want to talk about it with me
well i still recommend it if youre not concerned about the possible issues ive found lsd to be the least inconsequential drug to my health while mixing and stuff and also the besturl its not quite an opera but it looks hyperactive behavior a good time
is your birthday coming up you could host a nice birthday party and see everyone and then check out after that or if you cant wait that long have some other party or organize a rafting trip or barbeque chili cook off or something
well maybe you should smoke some weed then god put it on earth so people could deal with all the shit
do you want to discuss your addiction do you think propensity towards addictive behavior is a genetic thing i like to think so as it makes me feel better about myselfif its not drugs and ill include alcohol as a drug what are you addicted to
ive been through a couple tough break ups but those were online relationships this is the first person ive found in my town who likes me and she is trying to break up with me because she thinks she is not good for me because she dislikes cuddling and snuggling id much rather be with her for the rest of my life than cuddle or snuggle ever again
you know what you should doinstead of thinking about killing yourself just pack up your stuff and leave leave everything behind dont let this be the end of your life but the start of a new one dont live on the street find a hotel to stay at hitchhike rent a car whatever and your family probably doesnt think of you as a burden imagine a burden you would be if you killed yourself depression on everyone further financial problems with funeral costs and such etcalso think of dying this way you will be sent into oblivion forever no you wont know it but you will not exist anymore not eating breathing running anything make your existence meaningful and dont throw it away carelessly i hope you can find your way out of this
i feel you bro sometimes i just want to stop living my life and do nothing does your parents know you are feeling this way if they call you lazy bum like my step dad did tell them that you feel like you have nothing to live for or something to that effect let them know because they may not know why youre the way youre acting if they are at least somewhat knowledgable theyll know what depression means and try to be more understandingas for your friends i dont knowmaybe bring someone into your circle of friends and start having some kind of group therapy i think this would be a great opportunity to create a support group and start talking about your feelings with one another start meeting up once or twice a asthenia if youre a high schooler decide on how often you wanna meetthe point here is start talking to someone it helpsa lot more than youd ever know
nothing like that is treatable treatment by all means does not make things disappear and therapy and support groups might be one of those things you always have to go do mental health treatment isnt magic you have to help yourself as well
i dont think i would ever actually do it because of the ache it would cause to the people who do care about me that said the thought consumes me i usually cant go a day without wishing i could kill myself also its been going on so long it doesnt really shock me anymore when i get these thoughts its almost become normal unbearable but normal i should probably give you some background info so you can better grasp the situation at hand ive been having near constant thoughts of suicide and self harm for at least the past four months sometimes it would get better sometimes worse but the of death always lurked underneath whatever positive demeanor i had adopted that day since i started at a new school i began to feel better within a week i had found a group if friends that already liked me and i met a cute girl who seemed interested in me she invited me over to her house for a super bowl party so of course i accepted i met a girl there who was perfect she was beautiful had good taste metallic in music and actually liked me she actually liked me long story short we cuddled a bunch and when it came my time to ask her out and or kiss her i awkwardly screwed it all up i still thought we were dating for a few days though until she refused to talk to me this obviously was a crushing blogs to my self esteem which was already pretty much in the negative caitlyn the girl who invited me to the party came over a couple of times that week we got closer and eventually ended up in my making out in my bed we got touchy feely and eventually i thought i made her cum she told me that it needed to stay between us which i was fine with the next day she told me we need to forget anything ever happened i gave her a note asking to talk about it and she replied why its not hyperactive behavior much happened anyway no offense it should be noted this was my first time even kissing a girl so it was something to me to say the least anyway theres more but im just gonna let you comment on that part first
theres always someone out there it doesnt have to be video games find a hobby teach yourself how to do something neat hyperactive behavior finger pencil spinning or something
nothing unhappy is normal or perhaps more accurately happy is the exception happiness only happens periodically its what makes the rest of the mediocre and unhappy times worthwhile this is fundamental to the human condition this is not as hopeless as it sounds people are perfectly capable of being contented with mediocre and essentially just being chill with the idea of the happy times being something to look forward to and the rest being basically pointless we evolved that way mostly work hunting gathering with the good times in the evening around the fire it is when we start to believe that happy is normal that everyone else is happy and theres something wrong with us if were not perpetually cheerful that we get woundup and stress with the mediocre times and everything then becomes an effortful struggle to get to that mythical place where everyone is happytheres nothing wrong with you perhaps more significantly theres nothing different about you either the vast majority of people are at about the same place as you are you can learn to live well with it and to enjoy and look forward to the evenings around the fire
check your life insurance policy most have exemptions for suicide shitty right so you would have to make sure it does not look hyperactive behavior a suicide
thanks for your support but i just feel so trapped i cant get over the fact that if i made different choices if i had gone to the same university as my friends or gotten proper treatment sooner or what have you my life would be much more enjoyable right now im just paralysed by regret and i honestly dont think it will ever go away its just become who i am
its cool man lifes tough and you got to remember noone said it would be easy and it may not cheer you up much to say this but weve all been there i remember my anxiety mental depression attacks and man were they embarrassing most people wont admit it but mental depression is kinda a normal thing i irritable mood dont let it get the best of you but just take it for what it is eventually things work out but if it ever gets hard to stay on track just remember one thing your not dead for a reason that should be enough to keep your head up glad you cheered up though and dont increased sweating the small things cause life has a wierd way of showing you the good things in it though its usually after the bullshit has settled take care friend
are you still here what would convince you to get through today just this one day are you open to seeking helpi sincerely hope that youre still with us
im so sorry youre going through so much pain right now for what its worth im number and have never kissed a girl or have had sex yet so youre not alone there since youre definitely interested in losing weight one of the easiest things you can do is cut out soda and other sweetened drinks i had to stop drinking soda for a year because of my braces and i ended up losing something like number lbs in just a few weeks because i didnt have all of those empty calories i stopped having headache too something you seem to have too i figured out that my body had essentially become addicted to the sugar and caffeine from the soda so whenever i didnt have it i would end up having these massive headache and would be in an awful mood until i had onea really good way to meet people is to start up a hobby or mild sport i started taking karate earlier this year and the regularity of going to a place where everyone is trying to help everyone be better both physically and mentally is tired refreshing
its alright this school year ive been away from public school since october i really do hope i snap out of it its just really hard to be okay but you could be right i believe he loves me now at least and im lucky to at least have that in my life to look forward to
stress and anxiety mental depression cant be helping but there are foods i cant process properly namely those drug abuse in fat protein and fiber which squares up with gastroparesis a polyposis gastric emptying test was used for the initial diagnosis the question now seems to be whytheres often an underlying condition or other trigger as for dealing with all of this stress your suggestions certainly cant hurt unlike most of my strategies for dealing with emotional pain ill give it a shotat worst it might keep my mind occupied for a whileim not trying to be down on my friendhes very dear to me and he saved my life as surely as if hed physically removed me from a burning building but i really did resent him at the beginning i cant imagine where he found the patience to deal with me
im over the people that have pain me in the past i wouldnt say im upset by my past im more afraid of the future im a lot happier when im with my boyfriend because he always makes sure im smiling and laughing i know that i want to move in with him but my employment status is the sole thing keeping me from being with him where im happy im miserable at home because im usually alone it makes me feel bad because he wastes a lot of excessive upper gastrointestinal gas to come see me if i was able to hold down a job i could be with him all the time and since someone would always be there with me i wouldnt worry about my safety as much at home
yeah expectations and comparing myself to others are two of the biggest problems i have i tend to put other people on pedestals which definitely makes things harder on myself it means that any problems there are in the friendship must be my fault and i just end up feeling hyperactive behavior crap im pretty excited to start dbt though for the first time in a long time im feeling somewhat hopeful about the chances of getting over this it just seems so permanent when youre going through it
i have been to australia beautiful place i know there are things to do and places to see at one time that intrigued me even when i was tired depression a few years ago i could hang on to that but now i just dont even care about any of that id travel somewhere if someone got me a ticket but i would just feel neutral i could take it or leave it i dont feel joy anymore
longest maybe a month at most i dont really know sorry im being kinda useless
i get you im number no one would ever guess how truly sad i am no one the meds arent so bad i kinda wish they did numbness everything but they dont i watch the world go by idk why but the worst part is never being in love i try very very hard i even joined a co ed number in league to make friends but i come up empty i have a really big heart but no one wants it i get what you irritable mood about not being meant to live this life i often find myself thinking that i am only here to make other people happy i make them smile and laugh hyperactive behavior im a clown but its so dark on the inside an i just want someone to see i want someone to understand
try to find some way to psychiatric help if you dont already have it more often than not this desease is stronger than any one person and to get better person needs almost always someone who can see things from outside as often in mental diseases you cant see objectively
why must you be haunted by the past youre still unwilling to accept the fact that this perspective is surmountable and that you can look back on this as a time where you nearly gave in but overcame it i strongly believe that college will do wonders for you if you throw yourself into it judging by how you speak you seem incredibly intelligent which is exactly what will help you succeed in college it is a time to start anew far from everyone and everything that reminds you of how you feel your mind will still be with you but it will be busy processing everything thats going on though sociability is a key part of college connecting with professors and ras is also a major part and often even more satisfying if you extract yourself from your own selfdeprecation and engage with all that surrounds you im sure that youll see some value in itdo this for me extract yourself from how you are feeling now when was the last time you felt joy euphoria bliss there was a time was there not it can come again too no matter the struggle there is a way to overcome it
the only certainty regarding death is that you never really know how it will affect youno one who understands death could so readily wish it upon another i think especially to their face their words are just that and nothing more had they ever experienced a death especially one by such senseless means as suicide i doubt those words would cross their lipsyou cant predict how death will affect you for all your life you may have grown up hating and resenting a deadbeat alcoholic father only to crumble at his passing this is hardly uncommonplease dont make a choice based on what others want of you and especially not based on what you think they perceive of youi wont tell you what to do or what the right decision is but if youre going to make a decision i want you to make it for yourselfthats allplease feel free to reply in any form if youd like to talk
from the day i was born its been nothing but problem after problem theres no break my schizophrenia childhood home broke down my mom and i went from house to house we ended up in the ghetto people smoked meth on the front porch broke into our house daily sometimes through my room then i lived with other people and got the shit beat out of me for number years after that got the shit beat out of me all freshman year drank myself into a number month blackout and now i dont remember number years of my life i got through it everything was ok for about number years and now this i cant do it all again
what is suicidal ideation how do you ask this
im not saying she doesnt matter as a person i just see a lot of kids with the fml attitude and over what i didnt get an ipod for christmas fml really an ipod that will be out of date in a few years and your whole life is ruined i saw money issues as a problem but honestly those are her parents concern dont take on problems that are not yours dont measure yourself against other people there will always be someone better measure yourself against who you were yesterday and you may not always win but you will get betterand finally i was saying find a better mentor to hang around than her parents teacher coach who knows probably not people off the internet but learn about life from people that are successful at it or something anything
have you seen a shrink and told them you have strong suicidal urges
hi there thrawai i have a couple of family members and at least two exes who have struggled with the black void that is depression there are a couple of things i need to sayfirst of all you may not know this especially if youre feeling this right now but depression twists the mind tendrils of self loathing fear and feeling hopeless slowly and stealthily worm their way in around your mind warping your perspective and making the world grey its not your fault its a sicknessjust like any sickness you need to get to a doctor get to an emergency room a clinic or whatever start with a prescription maybe when your neurochemicals are stabilised you could try some cognitive therapy stay away from bullshit like acupuncture homeopathy and religion that shits not proven and youll only get worse waiting for a placebo to kick inid tell you that the outside stuff can be fixed and i do believe it can in my opinion though you need to take care of your inner pain before you can make your outer life betterive seen this disease ravage people i love and its terrifying your reactions to people ie lashing out or whatever could be your depression your illness tricking you into paranoia anger and fearget help quick my thoughts are with you friend
did you even bother reading the rest i hate repeating myself so why dont you go ahead and take a look at why im really suicidal
i think either management doesnt care if they lose me or that im being set up to get fired they believe that unemployment along with overtime is a cardinal sin and its common practice to dirty up someones record to prevent a successful unemployment claimim actually going to talk to the owner tomorrow hes kept in the dark about all this of course and see about a transfer if he cant help and supposedly he really likes me then ill have to see about moving on i applied to about number temp agencies and number parallel companies ill be applying for more tomorrowim not sure about the reference ive seen them blow off reference calls for people they dont like which is the same as a bad reference plenty of other coworkers have volunteered for references for me though im popular with customers and employees alike just not with as my friend so aptly put it the ones who matteri cant and wont discuss suicide with my friend he lost one of his identical twin sons about number or number years ago when his son stole my friends gun and shot himself in the mouth on my friends bed hes just not ready to hear that from me although id really like to talk with him about it as he is my best friend and understands me more than any other living soul

why yes i think about this everytime i feel depressed mood andor sad how laughably small motes we are in the vastness of existence then i remember that one thing i simply must do you should find one too i wont say what mine is because its a stupid and foolish little dream but hey thats what keep me going the fuel that powers the little engine that is my body havent really lurked much in here so i hope i didnt went against the rules of the community by speaking in this manner
not entirely true while i do struggle with suicidal thoughts my urge to throw myself off a bridge is purely out of curiosity to see what would happen even though im pretty sure it would kill me

whats your degree in how old are you
but that isnt how the system works as much as you would like to believe that people who need help get help in reality unless they can see it number you arent getting shit especially with schizophrenia if you know you need help but its all in your head you need to express to the less known that its a real problems so an act of somesort might be necessary it isnt disgusting the world isnt perfect
i appreciate the advice just felt really discouraged and fantasized of death im going to try volunteering while i apply
you are more than your test scores you have a lot to offer friend and you are just getting started one day number years from now youll remember those days when you felt suicidal and youll be happy youll be happy that overcame everything what are your interests
the thing is i dont want to live for myself i really like that last sentence though
thank you for taking the time to thank me and to comment on my commentit begins
i garden and exercise i tried learning to play music to ease the isolation but im terrible at it no talent at all so its no fun and the less said about me attempting art the better i recently got cats and they help a little its a shame ill have to find a new home for them before i gothe problem is these things can only ever distract me temporarily from the lack of human companionship theres no escaping it the thing is i can meet and talk to people but im incapable of developing true friendship the best i can do is develop a circle of distant acquaintances nothing else interests me i dont care about money or success whatever thats defined as by society now im also completely talentless so theres little else i can do other than go to work every day until i diealcohols the only medication that works but even that has its limits i tried ssris but they had almost no effect and eventually stopped working completely within months
its great that your talking with her how did she react to it also what kind of mind altering stimulant if you never told anyone else did you find it dificult to come here and share your story
i know its hard the only reason i havent killed myself is because i know how much it would pain my mom its a shitty reason but its a reason i guessedit plus dude you gotta take care of godzilla
i am starting to consider my therapist as a friend i know she isnt really but she seem to genuinely care about me i know when the appointments are over i will be loosing her but for now it feel kinda good to have a friend i am afraid of loosing her but i know its coming i might try to hit the park a few times this asthenia take in some suns and try to meet others i know the parc isnalways full and only a few blocks from my house i hope it help
yeah you think the grass is greener but going to big schools big school loans although degree does not equal drug abuse paying job community colleges are not bad choices if you are the straight a student dont anxiety about not having a job if not then you could be working a job building experience and then using that degree to qualify you for a promotion in a company where people already know youi cant really comment sexuality thing personally i dont anxiety about telling people my sexual preference you feel hyperactive behavior you have something to hide i really dont see why people need to know i think a lot of people make it their identity what makes them stand out if you are with a person to standout you are not really with that person then again on second thought just say you are gay then you can play the gay card pretty much anywhere and have things handed to youi agree with stuckeynumber that its partly and esteem issue its self esteem not the esteem everyone else gives you you just need more aspects to you life than school and sexuality preference so when number falls you have something else to feel good about
im sitting here in cape town south africa and the night is beautiful and warm theyve lit up the mountain tonight its a beautiful place and one that i think everyone should see if youd hyperactive behavior to have the chance to see it or experience any of the millions of other beautiful things this life has to offer you need to pick up the phone right now and either dial number or your countrys local emergency hotline or a friend dont end your story hyperactive behavior this pick up the phone
i feel like youre a lot stronger than you think you are wanna talk to me
rejection can suck sometimes but at least you know that you want a good life for yourself and future spouse thats reason enough to not give up dont let it bring you down i wish you the best of luck
whats the point in going through life putting all your love towards something that will never return the feeling maybe if i up and leave the place im in because every corner is just another memory of my mind and heart being broken although i have no way to leave right now so im just trying to work on getting out and maybe ill find somewhere i can call home i feel like such a dick for saying it but the people who are in my life and who love me just dont seem like enough because i cant fully connect with any of them even the person who is my best friend i still feel really distant and detached i feel like i bring everyone down when im with them or at least when they ask me whats wrong and demand to know they can tell somethings off with me even when im trying to hide it but i just feel like a burden because i cant over this pain
not really when im like this i just want to chain smoke and drive too fast in the rain with the windows down
in my opinion the first need thing you should try is to not feel ashamed you did nothing wrong what you did you did out of love you are not the one who should be ashamed its the person who you trusted that should be we all have failed relationships and the feelings that you have feeling used worthless are pretty much on the normal side but you need to talk about it to overcome those feelings with anyone you should try your parents after all you already came out to them and what happened to you happens to a lot of people and it hurts the same way to everyone of them being conservative shouldnt prevent them from understanding what you are going through if you still dont feel confortable with them you always have a bunch of strangers right here that are willing to listen to you
well im truly saddened by this its people like you that make me truly happy you existed but saddened you must go keep it real brother x
the reason i believed in that quote was because the first time i read it was when i first started taking medication i was so happy during that time i wanted to scream i was so happy i had no worries if i were to kill myself i wouldnt do it because of the pain and bullshit in my life i would do it because i wouldnt think there is meaning to life i dont care if there is beauty on the other side why does it matter if there is god i hate my way of thinking
my dad died when i was two my mom remarried i still wonder what he was hyperactive behavior how much i was hyperactive behavior him and what my life would have looked hyperactive behavior if he had still been here you form an essential part in the process of your child to learn who she is id much rather have my dad died when i was number number number or now to me not knowing my dad is a source of unrestlessness that i will never be able to get rid of i cant imagine how i would feel if i found out that my dad didnt just die but committed suicide as a result of having me that would seriously fuck me up thisurl encapsulates beautifully what i irritable mood about having another dad because your real one cant handle you his biological dad is a prick dont be that person i understand that it is hard but you need to get help talk to your husband about it he is your husband men dont understand the subtle ques of women tell him directly whats up and if you seriously cant do that seek therapy something he will advise you to do anyway i hope you will feel better
it sounds like you are dealing with a crippling disorder seeking help is the right thing to do it is unfortunate that your medical contacts have so far been unable to help youi will suggest that you speak to your therapist about your suicidal thoughts and feelings of being followed and request a different one if you feel they have given up on you you have not given up completely otherwise you would not have posted here
no if you do something stupid like hurting yourself youll destroy her life how will the people who care about you feel if you pain yourself youll feel better and normal again trust me dying is not the answer let nature take care of that everyone makes mistakes dont beat yourself up over it at least give your girl a chance spill your guts to her and let her decide if she still loves you
sounds hyperactive behavior youre on the right track good luck
what about masters programs at other schools
the classic existentialist problem maybe look into some of their writings ill be honest and say i dont have an answer but heres a lame childhyperactive behavior analogy when you build a sand castle you know at the start the tide is going to come in and wash it all away to nothing making it totally futile yet still you choose to build one and lovingly craft it and even look forward to it why
this is a truly amazing story im glad you got through this
that sucks why not move to a city where you dont need a car
it was in august but yes i have seasonal affective disorder i guess i know deep down that its just winter but stilleverything seems so hopeless
please dont do that there will always be more out there for you i dont know your situation with your ex and i cant imagine how much she meant to you but she cant be the only person on this earth who can make you feel the way you felt maybe if she is someone elseplease spend time with your family watch the super bowl even if you dont care about it appreciate the stupid things your family says and the way they act together and just be part of it maybe even talk to someone about how you feel bad you dont have to say youre suicidal just say im having a hard time or i dont know what to do with myself just dont be alone right now i know it feels hyperactive behavior it helps but it wont just please reconsider
my take its that suicide is diving into nothingness from something if you have ever seen the money comercial there is a guy asking a baby if he wants more money or no money think like this if you are depression and you want to commit suicide the slim tiniest bit of life that you can enjoy is better than nothingness right who would want nothing over something nobody
i have talked to my dad yeah does nothing so i dont tell him about my depression as well we barely talk or hang so by the time we do i feel better maybe i feel better being with him it just sucks being pain oh one thing i left off sexually assaulted this summer
thanks for responding i wish i could let you peak into my head so you could understand i have no phobia social skills i have no ability to fall in love im alone and doomed to be alone she was my first major relationship true but it was one that i know cannot be matched i just cannot keep going on with out her i love her so much and im just a bad memory for herthe longer i live the more bad memories pile up and intensify i need to get away from them i need to escape
zoloft and lexapro and effexor all made my mental depression worse and almost killed me i would try to ge off of them if i were you and just be regularly depressed mood hyperactive behavior most people instead of actively suicidal
dont give me that its just the constant let down of people around me to the point where im donei failed the first time in killing myself i wont fail again
working is the only thing that doesnt make me feel numb i feel hyperactive behavior my work is the only thing i am good at
thank you for your words its really heartwarming i usually care about others more than about myself ita a part of why i find it so hard to continue for myself i hope ill find someone who care about me for myself
u will get through this maybe scream instead of cry i would rather be angry then sad your strongamazing and resilient this too shall pass
thanks for this i was working with my dad today at my grandmas house and i took a break sat down and thought i thought alot about suicide i was thinking i could go into her closet and shoot myself with her gun and it would be over but i wouldnt ever do anything that dramatic i was just lost today and i took a nap then woke up and went to work i got over the bump today and i know i can tomorrow
and thats why i stopped taking antidepressants
i am amazing just getting bullied at work accused of some nasty stuff its not true im a good guy im just bad with some people i work with im number i shouldnt be in this position ill never be able to retire ive got this one stupid exit and no matter how i plan it now i dont believe i can do it im getting alienated and marginalized and im just too old for it when i was a kid i hated it but i guess i just have a soft spot for it now
there are other things as well that a friend sent me i think one of them was drawing on your wrist making it look like you were bleeding then pouring like warm water that is colored like blood over it to make it look and feel as though you are bleeding
thanks gompert i do appreciate itshelving away the notion that said enjoyment is forcedmanufacturedhow do you do that i cant bring myself to do it at all i have this weird mindset that comes and goes of being real or whatever and not distracting myself from everything like everyone else does i know how egotistical andi dont know dickish that sounds i really do hate myself for even just writing that i just cant bring myself to do italso do you know me you have a writing style tired similar to a friend of mine that i havent talked to in awhileagain you have nothing to be sorry about i can relate with you tired well right nowthank you again
i just pain all the time im so tired of feeling thats all i want to stop feeling
really nice i hyperactive behavior the choice of quote and the way youre prioritising your mental health keep on fighting
oops i remembered life is pointless oh well guess theres always going to be some young person who thinks lifes grand bang
i dont see anyone for sa i went to a dr a few years ago but i just ended up feeling embarrassed and never actually saw a psychologist i dont hate myself for being gay anymore than the fact that i hate myself for being a complete failure its just another thing that makes me feel abnormal your whole hyperactive behavior is geared up to be straight its just expected a guy and a girl walk by holding hands and nobody thinks anything of it two guys and everyone stares and some people have to make their comments there are probably thousands of people that hate me for being gay and they dont even know i exist its just another thing that i wish i didnt have to deal with i dont know what im going to do for school i dont inherently dislike school i enjoy learning its one of the few things that i hyperactive behavior in life the little moment when you learn something new or finally understand something difficult but now i feel hyperactive behavior im so far behind i spent so many years just getting by and now its all caught up with me that and the constant little mistakes i make on assignments and tests switching signs in math problems losing pieces of problems thinking too quickly and making stupid little mistakes then the professor rips my tests to shreds because i screw up one tiny piece of a problem and of course the whole problem is therefore wrong its so frustrating thanks for reading and the reply im glad youre getting your life back on track
i will i guess i am in a haze right now i found myself tempted to look for my fathers guns this isnt good i try to convince myself nothing is wrong but there is im sorry thank you guys
its kind of cathartic in a way it lets me take out my feeling unhappy with and feeling angry at myself or others in a way thats not physically dangerous i get some of the feeling of release without the consequence of you know actually dying i guess its kind of similar to selfinjury in a way but im not physically harming myselfi hope youre okay
giving yourself permission for what dont think hyperactive behavior that you have many things that you might not even see its hard to be positive at times and im not going to push that on you that being said photography is a wonderful thing they say a picture is worth onethousand words maybe starting a blog or a tumblr will help you understand your potential
you arent alone man i know how hard it is to be apart of a culture where sex seems to be the only thing that matters i feel hyperactive behavior since i have not had it that i am failing at life but then i look at the people who have had a lot of it look at what they are and i ask myself what makes them so much better than me is it female attraction could be but is that man single yes does that man have a lot of sex yes is he happy no i had a roommate in college who used to have sex a lot must have had number partners in the span of a couple months this guy ended up sleeping with a girl i liked and ended up stabbing me in the back by lying about it thats the kind of person he is i know that i am better than him because i would never do that yet he did is that the kind of person i am no so maybe its better that i am who i am because i know that when i do find that someone and trust me even i know i will despite the fact that i tell myself i am going to be alone forever i will be the best possible person for that woman because of what i have gone through what i have learned about myself you may be desperate but desperation has only one direction as far as im concerned and that direction is up if you are low enough to be desperate than you cant fall any further just tell yourself that you arent going to be down in that desperation zone forever but it doesnt happen over night you cant expect good things hyperactive behavior that because if its worth having it doesnt come to you without a fight put up that fight make it one for the ages and show yourself that you are better than you thought you were
not knowing your situation well enough i cant say that your life will without any doubt get better that said it most certainly can get better and if i were a betting man id bet that it will but lets get to know you better why do you feel like you have no clue what to do and how do you feel like you are a burden on your family do you think they would agree
you described exactly how i feel about relationships on the one hand i feel like i can really make a difference in someones life if i were to be in a relationship with them but that kind of thinking led me to a onesided and toxic relationship i think everyone is deserving of love but i cant see anything to love in me i dont know youre right its hard to tell what is a lie and what isnt
could you tell me a bit about yourself unless you want to go you have fulfilled the task of keeping me away from selfeuthanasia so i think youre job is done
please know if you need to talk i will listen youre not alone
resources arent family they are things like groups for victims of sexual assault who are capable of hooking you up with a network of people to talk to therapy mental health pretty much a host of things under the sun family and friends are support systems but they arent in a position to truly help you other groups are unfortunately your story is not unique and plenty of people have unfortunately gone through what you have
well i dont know what else to say i appreciate your attempt in this thread i guess the outcome was expected
it sounds like you really love your cat and i totally understand that love i love my cat too i dont think youre crazy for being concerned about your cats wellbeing it also sounds like youre in a lot of pain if you dont mind sharing and want to talk im really curious about whats been on your mind lately
well ive got time but theres quite a lot going on could you be more precise on your question please
you think so little of yourself but the woman you described isnt the kind that would post here anxiety is a really hard thing to live with but by posting here youve overcome it at least in a small way college is hard work its not for everyone and it takes dedication and concentration otherwise it wouldnt be a big deal when people graduate yet you see tears of joy all throughout the crowd at a graduation ceremony if you decide you cant do it now you can always come back i dont know how you look i cant say you arent fat but what i can say is that someone thinks youre beautiful someone out there in this world someone in the numbers of people whove seen you over the course of your life thinks youre beautiful even just statistically speaking someones out there wishing theyd asked you out at that starbucks at safeway in the parking lot at school wherever it might be and there isnt anything wrong with being heavy anyways im very overweight and my last two girlfriends have been heavier than me beauty is in the eye of the beholder you need to stop looking at yourself as being that suicidal little girl youve grown since then youve overcome challenges youve gotten stronger and right now youre doing one of the most difficult things in the world youre asking for help think about that honestly stop reading and think about what it took to reach out and say everything you junumberst did to openup your heart to currently numbernumber readers and say this is me please help me thats one of the most difficult and terrifying experiences i can imagine especially with anxiety mental depression issues so in saying all this and asking for help havent you proven to yourself that youre stronger than that it doesnt take courage to overdose not even a little it takes weakness weaknes that you have not shown youve shown courage and the will to live the strongest instinct our genus and any species in eistence posseses youve shown that you dont need to give up you dont need to od you dont need to leave because no matter how hard it is you just asked over numbernumber people for help over numbernumber strangers so heres your help miss marbles youre better than that whether you think so or not i know so so even if it hurts even if its hard and scary and its the last thing you want to do stay alive
thank you very much for the picture i printed it out the second i saw it you put a big smile on my face thank you againpsdamn you drew that
but whats another optionblame the bullies not the victims dont teach people that they should have to put up with the horrible people in their lives but try to teach people not to be horrible people support people rather than criticizing them for being hurt especially in a community like this
i dont think about suicide as much and its harder to get boners
i know the feeling of being cheated on ive been told to my face by my exboyfriend that hes never loved me at all never got a confession for the cheating either so i completely understand where you are coming fromim really really impressed that youve been strong enough to keep it together for your family especially for your kids i can tell from your post that youre a genuinely kindhearted person since the blame you put on your wife is so minimal and no matter how tired you get i hope that seeing your children makes it worth itlet me know if you want to talk more and chin up
hmm probably shouldve mentioned im actually number xenumberxbnumberxanumber_xenumberxbnumberxanumber and cause you asked im in quebecalso things actually have been getting worse a lot worse hyperactive behavior i expected my girlfriend broke up with me today and i literally have nothing to look forward to in life my desire to die is seriously at its highest right now and i cant do sports because i am not fit enough it hurts whenever i run even if its for short periods of time i usually play guitar in my spare time as mentioned earlier
ive been there and ill throw my two cents in your teacher asked because they were concerned someone cared that you were there reflect on that chances are nobody else even gives a shit if youve put on a few pounds shit happens man youre not going to class to be judged and neither is anyone else youre going there to learn and so is everyone else just keep your mind to your studies as best you can i know it isnt easy being depressed i can speak personally about this however you signed up for the class in order to go there and learn new things and advance yourself what harm can it do to learn a thing or two
and how do you exactly believe money has perverted this not because i disagree just trying to understand better
sometimes death looks hyperactive behavior a pretty good option you arent the first to think it but and i might get banned for this please read the whole thing i love this sub imagine if you did i know you think youd have peace that youd have a release from all your problems but then what i dont know what happens after this life and it doesnt matter but you cant possibly be done with everything you want to do already youre the same age as me and i know that i still have a lot i want to do im sorry that you had a breakup that shits tough im sorry you were abused thats terrible as well im sorry that you dont have the perfect family and that you think youre falling apart at the seams truly but why give up what does that really accomplish youre a scientist a successful student by your own credit you can make advances that could benefit this world for years to come maybe even find a permanent solution to mental depression who knows i sure the hell dont but what i do know is that youll never find out if you just give up so dont fiht to the bitter end but you arent alone at the very least you can talk to me and whoever else is willing to listen when you feel broken and need a crutch i think you can stand on your own i think that this is a crucible for you a moment in your life where two things can happen you live and grow stronger for the experience or you dont but right now that is entirely up to you youre life has barely started why end it now
it doesnt stop me from trying its not fair to put them through painbut its not fair to make me stay and prolong the painjust to get the same outcome in the endthats why if it were possible to just disappear from existence and take all memories of me with me it would be done
i dont have any advice for you sorry just wanted to say that you are a good person and there arent many people hyperactive behavior you
i was going to do something pretty bad too but i wont saya lot of these things are phases i found that out today when i wrote down my thoughts did something else for an hour came back and was shocked its hyperactive behavior that feeling people get as theyre halfway from jumping off something high when everything seems to make sense and your goals seem so tangiblei saw my dad walking my dog he just got neutered recently he is really cute its these little things that keep me goingyou should take a walk i will in a bit too
im grateful to you for always replying im trying my best to get myself into different things and keep myself always busy with something ive been sketching and singing as my hobby but the negative atmosphere and cold irritable mood of people no matter how hard i try its still the same
that last option besides dying on the battlefield actually sounds like a great idea just find away to leave even fighting isis find something that doesnt require any sort of payment since i am in a large amount of debt also i know how you feelbasically getting away from this awful sounding family of yours and finding your own purpose in life instead of letting it slip awayi really wish you good luck
where are you studying in the united states a lot of people have jobs that arent related to their degrees but just having a degree makes it easier to get a job of some kind not knowing all the circumstances of your situation i would say that you should try to stick it out you are not writing the whole book just this one chapter what comes after is unknown and full of possibility in terms of classmates and friends it seems to me that you need to branch out you may have been so fixated on your boyfriend that you unconsciously excluded everyone else from your life open up a little and see what happens just a smile can really work wonders or you could talk to your adviser and see about changing your major you said you have a scholarship and those usually have limitations but maybe you could switch from aerodynamics to say math or chemistry what do you hyperactive behavior better could you angle your classes in such a way that they are more palatable i need to go to bed i work tomorrow and i am tired but please do pm me if youd hyperactive behavior to talk further i hope i helped you at least a little
true i based my conclusion on bad stories really ive heard some good but they seem to be a minority who most of the times have an unusual condition and like you said most people who are on medication dont recommend them to others ive heard your story a few timesive never heard of hypothyroidism tho i will digg into that but i doubt it is what i have number years ago i was in the same place as now but in a less degree i did a lot of research and rebuild my mind from the ground up clean slate and trying to be positive againschool it worked out number years ago my life was going up had a nice job a nice home and i could go on vacation without to worry about anything really then the crisis came and took everything ive build in number months lost everything im now back living with my mom because its almost impossible to hold a job longer then number weeks the market is just screwed up from then i slowly got back in this dark place ive tried believe me i tried i just watched everything i worked so hard for die out i tried even harder then before to regain it but no success all the doors are closed for me now the only thing i can do is go back to school and start a new career in a different sector getting a bigger debt and wasting number years of my life again but i feel its just the government and stuff playing games with us i dont want to be a pawn in their schemes aandd now im here
oh i see your wife is vilifying you in the eyes of her children an incredibly rotten thing to do to the father of your children hate this because i told you to hate this i dont know you guys so i dont know if its a justifiable course of action on her part but i know its depressed moodi think you both might be selling your daughters short if you think they wont bother to form their own opinions in do time isnt there some legal course of action you can take where the court forbids a parent from moving across the country i think you have a strong case since you can provide a much more stable atmosphere to raise kids in dont count yourself out of the parenting race just yet youre not done being a father just because of a divorce youll always be a father for as long as your girls live theyll need you less and less if they had good parents but for most people parents are hyperactive behavior anchors to their kids losing a parent is hyperactive behavior being a tight rope performing and losing your security net theyre only little girls still personally i would live a life that contradicts all the negativity my vengeful ex says live by action of good virtue if she tells them the sky is green and they see in fact that it is not green at all its hyperactive behavior in a way shes giving you all you need to prove you are a good man and a good father like in involuntary set up i think you owe it to yourself and and girls to prove everyone wrong if you cant keep them from moving to florida people are much more connected over long distances nowadays you can chat online face to face or play games with a headset and mic together you can insure you will always be available day to day for them and maybe still have some fun together in the process i think youre in a better position to turn things around then you realize thats emotions for you at first they overpower everything else then rational reasoning and logic pummel it into submission its just a matter of waiting for that anger truck to crest that dune and crush those cars i hope you rock the heck out of number number was an unlucky number
put it this way if you tired number times and failed there is a reason if it was something you really wanted to do you wouldnt have posted this and you wouldnt have had number almost check outs youve been through some awful shit there is no denying that and i am not trying to negate that but living and thriving after something like that is possible and you are not alone in your experiences or what you are feeling even if it feels that way
look yourself in the mirror and think of all your friends and all your family and how youre going to ruin all of their lives if you do this that this face in the mirror might be the last thing that you make them see youre about to reach your schizophrenia childhood dream why would you quit now you have so much potential right now dont let your selfishness take over just imagine how youd feel if you were in their shoes dont do this
many of your thoughts are similar to mine few years ago and i feel so sad that you too are going trough this no one should feel this way world however seems to put so much on some people and i think its unfair still i have no real ideas what to do to help you im here listening though if that helps any
well its always easier said than donei will attemp this thank you for the article and the new perspective i just hope i have the motivation neededim not really sure how to respond to that doesnt happen often erm thank you
you are such a wonderful person for lords sake dont you ever go anywhere
idk im depression and i failed miserably and i just cant stay here longer i am going to die sooner or later but i used to be religious when i was a kid and now since im a teenager i kinda just lost my faith but now that im close to death im scared of rotting in hell rotting because suicide is seen as the worst sin in every religion out there
i dont know why i want to livei felt this way last year existential questions are tired important to some of us while for others its never a concern and the thinking is expected to be dealt with some other way within this responsibilitydodging society most lines of thought arent approached by therapists because they of course have stable lives in the economic system dont see a need to question it most people in the world in fact cant offer up the experience to handle these questions so theyll pretend theyre not importantsince we dont have a lot of space here possibly ask yourselfnumber why you are driven to ask this in particularnumber if your line of thought could be biased by being in this positionnumber if youd find a more certain answer by first becoming happy with yourselfnumber if you can be content with being who you arenumber if its okay to live every day with being ugly a failure or poor or homeless or blind etcnumber if you would try to put everything right given the chancefor what its worth i still think along those lines death today vs tomorrow every day even though my living situation and life in general isnt such a problem for me right now and i have to ask myself why im posting here but thats me and my existential worries my loneliness and lack of social life distraction talking distraction is the key word its the secret to how people never stumble across the big question more tasty food more nice clothes and so onenvironmental damage is something close to number of the people of the world are conscious of why be part of that low percentile its happening anyway whether you care about it or not this is the world thats been created and its the world thats here to stayreally these rationalizations are coming from having nothing to live for that youre excited about in the shortterm and by no means does that mean that they cant appear again people do not break the mind is tired flexible and adaptable its possible to fix your environment therefore its possible you can be happier with life that question never disappears completelyeverything with your life can be improved if youre serious all its ever concerned is the method knowledge skills that you apply
im so glad i was able to help in some way if theres anything else you want advice about feel free to ask me and ill do my best to answer i really hope everything works out alright for you
that sounds really painful and thank you for opening up about it ive had a similar kind of experience where i sort of ripped out my heart because it just pain too much and now i can barely feel love anymore above all none of its your fault and no one should be in so much pain its in no way pathetic or something that you should be ashamed about minds are extraordinarily complex and the way that mental health issues are treated by most is really bad ive found that being able to just plug in to a playlist on my ipod and temporarily shut things out has worked for me as a crutch to lean on the mail provider may also be able to do something i know how important having my reminder of things is to me and how hard it must be to not have yourstheres no way that i could hate you or even have a reason to ive been sitting here trying to work out if theres another way to chase that package if things get really bad please contact a suicide hotline before trying anything you deserve your organs so tired much and if i was able to i would offer you the biggest hug that i could give ive found that hugging a pillow can fill some of the void for me when i need it
and another thing if you feel you dont have enough friends you should sign up to some sort of club so you can meet for people a tip i got from someone else
was that the first time you really thought about suicide last night i mean
im not from the us so im not sure how things work there but do you have some sort of guidance or school counsellortherapist type of person there what you might also want to consider is confiding about this to a teacher that you trust if there is one and they might be able to point you in the right direction but again this might be a tired common mental disorder that you are experiencing that responds well to the correct empathic treatment your school will not be unfamiliar with it in general either mental illness is the big secret that noone talks about but is all too common
your family sounds like a bunch of really amazing people
your logic is good and you have a sense of humor
thanks for sticking around i dont know you but ive been worried about you since we stopped hearing from you
your parents unfortunately have serious issues of their own that doesnt make you a bad child or a bad person nor does it mean that suicide is an easy way out suicide is immense pain then nothinglife can go on you can talk to someone a school counselor an adult you trust like a nice teacher your parents suggesting you kill yourself is definitely grounds for some form of counselingas someone who knows many wonderful people who are the product of awful parents dont lose hope
what does numbernumbernumber irritable mood to you why that day also im here if you want to talk
my friends hasnt sought me out because i dont take the initiative to contact them itll be the same with family eventually theyll stop trying
well first things first you have us here and whilst it might not seem hyperactive behavior much being able to vent your feelings is a good way to start building back those bridges family always seems to be a difficult one you cannot choose your family but you can choose what interactions you have with them and whether they are positive or not the fact that you are here you seem more than intelligent and want help shows people you want to do something about it anyone who would ignore you for that is not going to be the best of friends its about finding the niche that you enjoy reddit is a great place for that at least what is it that you find yourself doing most of the time for a hobby computers reading etc just dont give up there is always a chance it will get better regardless of how dark it seems
hey zeppelin rules if youre a zeppelin fan that means obviously you enjoy and appreciate their music and probably other awesome music too maybe cream anyway if you appreciate the music then of course there are things out there that you can enjoy music and otherwise and who know what if the next zeppelin or jimmy page is right around the corner it would suck if you missed out on discovering them imagine how you felt the first time you heard stairway to heaven or whatever song you dig and know that that omg this is awesome moment canwill happen again so long as you stick around
people change their lives every single day where you are right now can be the end of a bad story or the start of a good one you need to get off the drugs and thats going to be hard but even though i do not know you the remorse you show for your actions speaks to some kind of inner strength you are beating the hell out of yourself i doubt anyone in your family or anyone you know would speak about you in these terms be gentler with yourself you might have problems but this isnt the solution
in agreeance with malvinnumberurl i suggest that you dont try to relate you dont try to push and dont try to tell her how bad it is that can only fuel their desire to self inflict consider just listening and when she asks questions find a sedated state way of putting it unless it become a life threatening issue avoid reporting it and keep what you hear to yourself and only you
oh my god do you actually love history im getting my degree in anthropology i love anthro i went into it because i cant wait to get a phd in my favorite subjectdo you love history and that whole stereotype about liberal arts degrees being useless is really stupid if you want me to go into it i will
not sure quite frankly ive had anxiety and depression is definitely apparent in my family tree but i really dont know if i have depression its always on and off ill be really sad for a period of time like a couple days at most then just normal never overly happy which is why i dont think im bipolar
youre very welcome what do you have your masters in
try and get her to seek a therapistthey will help her
haha as they say you can do anything you put your mind to although ive always felt like the people that work there are like the snotty clique at high school presumptuous and rude although i may feel bias because i work with waitresses and unless youre a regular or a fellow employee they always just slightly treat you like a second hand citizen anywhoim awfully tired today sorry i wasnt tired conversational this time about seems like we could both use an extra helping of sleep
please contact a suicide hotline before trying anthing theyll be the best qualified people to help with the immediate pain after that id recommend taking it day by day and trying to see if theres a treatment option that would be better for you id also recommend looking for an online support community i know that there are several for schizophenia they could probably help as well above all please keep in your mind how much change could come of a few things and just hold on to see if that would be the case because it could make so much difference im open to talking about things if you want to and again please contact a suicide hotline to help get through the night
its okay its not really an easy question to answer ive been trying to hang on to the fact that i dont hate everything but then sometimes i wonder if feeling nothing is worse you know i think its just life in general that leaves my unsatisfied i just dont see the point
doesnt seem like that is the case any more i no longer know how to talk to people
exactly thats what im trying to figure out i know that the number of people with bipolar disorder is very small so i dont know whether i have it or not i seem to exhibit quite a few of the symptoms of the disorder but then again there are some pieces missing from the puzzle
how long should i postpone it for its just really difficult to follow through
thanks for sharing your story and im sorry to hear things are so bad for you lets hope we can both find something worthwhile in this world before we take that final drastic step
boxingbrazilian jiu jitsumui thaifind something physical full contact that will allow you to pain and be painthe exercise will do you good as will the violence from there you shall find peace
try to forget about it if not melting ice on your skin might ease your mind just dont go overboard with anything best of luck
i need to watch some old disney stuff see if that cheers me up haha
you said that it helped you to have someone acknowledge that they read your post i know what that feels like im letting you know that i saw it too
are you sure they would kick you out theyre your family there is so very little that they could notwould not forgive my understanding is that your friend wants you too tell them but you want to keep quiet is why youre being driven apart at the end of the day its your choicedont let someone else push you into somethingif telling someone means you had to kill yourselfwellwe all have our secrets that will never see the light of day some things just arent trouble they would causegood luck with it allelzith
does your cat have another home to go to if you should die have you made any plans for itit sounds like you are capable of being a tired successful person socially your life has been filled with dramatic dysfunctional interpersonal relationships and you have been emotionally dependent on these relationships which is normal you still have friends and a significant other you seem like a competent writer with at least average intelligence i guess im pointing all this out to say that youre not in the most unfortunate of situations its still your right to want to die but if for some reason your suicide doesnt pan out theres some stuff to work with
another example of aspiration as a stupid destructive force look you are not going to be happy by having a particular physical appearance a certain weight a certain x a certain y or a certain z you wasted some time of your life some money which you claim to have plenty of and some of your motivation big whoop people go on and on about living life to the fullest and other arbitrary value judgmentalist mantras which irritable mood about as much as staring at a wall and seeing god there are probably other things you find enjoying but you keep on listing that crap hyperactive behavior it matters think about it you are a mammal surrounded by assemblances of tools and their biproducts you have resources at your disposal and you are complaining here is something to let you get over yourself i dont care noone here gives a damn beyond wanting to type some symbols for you to electronically infer the grunting noises they represent so you can in turn have an emotional reaction to them there better now go make some tea and get to know yourself or some other such shit
you my friend are not defined by your job you are defined by your actions blowing your brains out will certainly leave a mark on your loved ones i am here for you man
regular exercise and a lack of excessive stress is important to a good life so is a decent jobwork is now stressful yes its never doneim on a long break now its tired hot and humid where i now live so i cant really do anything i cant handle the heat well i want to prepare for my death before i go back to work
i know i sound like a brat im really trying to be understanding of their busy lives but its been number months of being on the brink and number months of no one to support me but myself or tired few times of those number months thank you for taking the time to listen you know ive just got so much on my mind i dont know where to start
its hard not to see things hyperactive behavior that though its the most simplest way try to trivialize someones problems by pointing out others have it worse or people with the same problem overcoming it i wish i could say i was better than that but im guilty of it as well i read posts here written by sad people but they say they have this or that and actually seem to be doing quite well aside from their sadness its something ive been on both ends of though perhaps as a benefit of dealing with it personally im far more understanding and compassionate about other peoples issues two people can have the same problem but one can solve it and the other can not how can the problem be worse if its the same its almost hyperactive behavior theyre not problems so much as mental barriers that are thinner for some and thicker for others some can walk through it hyperactive behavior its tissue paper or even air and others can hammer at it for years and year even indefinitelyi would mirror what the others have said but they said it better than i could if your normal friends wont listen there are people online that will
while my peers were partying and going to college i was in therapy trying to learn to like myself enough to be willing to live a little longer my husband had enormous financial and social success but his life was hollow until he devoted himself to getting whole emotionally moving to a new city and closing one of his businesses to do a particular therapy we have both benefited enormously for decades from getting help for our emotional upset distressthere are lots of well meaning incompetents out there but if you can find a good therapist and you make it your highest priority it might help buffer you against the sense of being overwhelmed by lifes ups and downs it certainly did for us for me personally being true to myself even when it is embarrassing or difficult is critical to my will to live even after all these years therapy isnt a panacea but sometimes just unpacking all the pain and fear and giving it a good airing reduces it to its proper proportion and makes it less overwhelming your suffering is heartfelt if you use it to gain insight it wont be wasted but rather productive
im glad you liked it ive visited it regularly for a while im happy to know others may appreciate it as much as i do
you remind me a bit of myself then i developed what i can only think of as a social phobia in secondary school high school i thought everyone was watching and judging me laughing at my appearance and so on i was terrified of going into public places and could barely speak with strangers it persists in a form even today when i hear people laughing i have to remind myself its not about me but thankfully the worst of it is past me nowso youd recommend some form of group therapy then
yeah actually finding something can be hard dont give up on that thoughbecause a life lived only for others will inevitably be an depersonalization onegolf rock climbing smoking weed drawing writing online games hunting acting sportsworking out pokemon gardening building things sewing cooking your possibilities are limitlessavoid alcohol and television though they will only exacerbate things
ah i see thanks for explaining strange how in english so many things are called collegewhy did you find it difficult to stay in the leys also the leys looks beatiful on google maps and i actually think i remember cats college
hey hang in there every second that passes is another second closer you are to feeling happy and another second youve survived feeling depressed youre right to think about how your girlfriend would react because letting go of your pain would just transfer it to her and everyone who loves you concentrate on the things that you like to do even if there arent tired many and push the negative thoughts out of your head its like learning a language over time you begin to speak so fluently that you dont have to train yourself to think in the language you just automatically do the same goes for being happy over time it will come naturally until then just keep trying i wish you the best
i can understand why you dont want your parents to know but i really think you should tell them id think they would find out sooner or later especially since you have to tell the doctor you could write it down and show them if that makes you more comfortable good luck were all here for you
ive been in the same position as you but number is the crossroads of all our lives high school may have been shit it was for me but college is a whole other world my advice to you is just give it a try wait for college to start go into it with an open mind and see where it takes youwhat side of the country are you going to school in
i too am in a similar situation but you are in a better position then me because you hold a degree i think you need to make a change in careers and aspire to do what makes you happy as for a date maybe you will find one online or in a new job you could find love in unexpected places but you are not going to find them in your house or in your head go with the flow its helped me work though my selfesteem problems they were always a problem for me
i cant say a lot of people can even imagine the pain you are going through right now there are still somethings i could suggest you might enjoy like music meditation and reading thats what i enjoy i go to a course in miracles sometimes they are really a loving group if you can find one around your area and attend however i also have influenzalike illness and can shit in a toilet on my own to be honest you make me feel so lucky as selfish as that sounds ive been so depression lately and you make me feel like a ridiculous spoiled child i dont know if telling you committing suicide is a bad or good idea because im pretty suicidal myself a lot of people are a lot of healthy people who have everything going for them they end their lives everyday so where does that leave you i dont know i dont know your situation enough and who is there rooting for you everyday besides the care giver loving you and making sure you have what you need just continue to be as strong as you are because its true youre much stronger than most to endure what you have to and when times get tough accept death is really just around the corner for all of us so why not try and make the most of what you have left
i am battling depression with suicidal and self harm thoughts and i have not told a single soul yet and i cant bring myself to say it or verbalize it in any way
that sure sounds simple in concept thanks for sharing that with me thoughits a big help and it makes complete sense but id genuinely never thought of it that way or at least not consciously on an unrelated note i just glanced at the first page of your post history and saw nethack high five youre officially awesome i still have to ascend a character in nethack seems like as good a reason as any to keep waking up every day
i really hope that helped you and i didnt say something completely wrong
if youd like to id be happy to read them
dont use that book as your basis of your understanding of us guys most of the time guys that hyperactive behavior want you to come up to them and take charge it may sound weird but its the truth try asking him out to do something just the two of you and see what happens
listen i cant tell you how to save yourself i know ive had some seriously bad lows in my life and i know whats stopped me but i dont know you what i do know is you shouldnt chest pain yourselfevery time ive gone down that dark tunnel ive found something on the other side to bring me back isnt there anything you want to do anything you want to see can you imagine yourself finding someone or something to fulfill you at the end of the day even if your day isnt perfect i know its hard i cant imagine how hard it is for you right now but you did the right thing coming here i and im sure dozens of others here would be willing to talk or listen if you want as long as you hang in there well be here with you
i have gastroparesis or hearing loss partial paralysis of the stomach and ive never known how to talk to my parents about ptsd or suicide or anyone else for that matter this is the most purely personal information ive ever shared on the subject if this was facetoface or if i knew you all i dont think i could have brought it up
i wanted to die in a way such that my death wont be much of a mess for anyone i went to a seashore about number kms away from where i live i threw away my phone licence and any things that will identify me i wrote a letter to my mom requesting her not to search for my body or bother to perform any last rites i asked her to stay away from all her insensitive family members and lead a peaceful life i asked her to not tell anyone that im dead if she has to just tell them that i died in an accident or something kept a note in my pocket saying that im an orphan and my body organs can be used wherever they are useful i found a secluded spot on the beach and ran in i dont know swimming i dont know how long i was there i could feel myself being dragged by one current into the ocean while a current of water passed by towards the beach from above it wasnt painless there was no option for me not to breathe air my body was forcing it self open and gulping in water i have a high lung capacity in between i surfaced twice or thrice above the water could open my eyes during the whole episode the waves were hitting me hard after a period of time i could feel the land just a oedema of extremity below me i was thrown back to the beach i was in shock im still in shock im unable to process anything during the episode i was happy that i was leaving all this shit behind after i got washed up ashore i was lying there for sometime two guys were close to me i dont know where they came from they were talking about me but didnt talk to me some people passed by i searched for my phone couldnt find it i had enough money in my pocket to make it home i lost my spectacles somewhere my eyesight is around number found it tired difficult to make my way to the bus stand im still tired much wanting to leave all this shit behind but im a coward im not able to bear that much pain i think shooting myself in the head is the best way to go but getting a gun in india is impossible for common people i dont know what to do if i had a little bit of courage i would have went back in but im a fucking coward
its almost comforting to see that its just hard having that kind of click in your head after working hard and with the notion that if your going to do something make sure it matters ive always been a firm believer in myself and my morals to be the change you want to see in the world so while i understand and i probably will to just suck things up and move upwards and onward the best i can is going to be the most obnoxious thing for mebut hey to each their own
if you wanna bone down demand they wrap their tool hahait seriously blows my mind that you would write so much to a total stranger im new to reddit and the people here are totally different than on any other social media thank you so much for encouraging me life is a really fucking tough journey and im only number i cant imagine what itll be like when if i make it to number youve surpassed a lot and i truly admire you id prefer to not be on any meds herbs and natural remedies intrigue me and as i get a better hold on the depression and suicidal thoughts i plan on stepping away from the pharmaceuticals your comment helped while nothing really fixes my desire to not be around its uplifting to know that a stranger took time out of their day to spare a kind word and share their story thank you so much
you sound like you need a break seriously take it slowly or youll combust you need to do something less stressful and calm down enough to pull yourself together since you can do freelance writing or tech support try joining ad revenue sharing sites like hubpages or daily two cents its not upfront pay but you can post about techie stuff and your posts will earn when they get a lot of views passive income or you can write an article about anything you want and sell it on articlesalecom or constantcontentcom
its incredibly inspirational to read that because you someone whos been though so much is still where you are right now and its humbling to know that someone that had gone through that much still cares and takes my problem seriouslyi wish this didnt pain so much i really wish it didnt the truth is it doesnt matter because in hindsight number years from now none of this will matter and keeping this in mind does help a little bitim trying to learn to love selflessly to love without expecting to be loved back and i think to do that i need to cultivate self love and i have but not enough to have it as the only love i need and i do believe that is possible to reach im trying not to be so greedy with love but i need guidance
hii want you to be happy i want you to be free from the suffering you seem to have a good heart this is rare i know a way to free yourself from external factors a way to gain happiness within meditation changed my life im not talking about some esoteric bullshit im talking about transforming your mind to live happy and peacefully you deserve it just pm me and ill tell you moretake care friend
heyhave you talked to a guidance counselor at your school or a teacher talking with someone oneonone instead of with your whole family could be more productive
hey so i just came over to this subreddit to have a look around and to try and educate myself on how other people feel your post was the first i saw i clicked on it and readwhatever you do dont pain yourself it is such a big mistake think of how amazing it is that youre here not to sound to cliche but your left hand is made from particles of a different one from your rightthink of all the beautiful places and things that you can experience its a giant word out there maybe you should take a few months break and explore do whatever youve ever felt like doing at this moment in time nothing should matter more to you than being happyi really hope you read this and hope that it makes a differenceim sure that there are many people to talk to either on line by call or in real life please dont do anything that will harm yourself please reply
can you go to a different doctor one that specializes in dealing with depression would be more helpful and more knowledgeable with antidepressants
been waiting to feel like a woman for number years no kids either honey i dont know your story is but just work your way outta the sleep just do it slowly one foot in front of the other you dont have to wake up over night but do wake up i know a few more answers will come your way if you do
its like looking in a mirror im just like you my suggestion is that you find a way to get a classmates facebook or aim or something if youre anything like me youd be a lot more comfortable talking in that kind of environment texting is good too make sure to tell them that you have trouble talking if they are worth being friends with they will help you then youd have someone to help with your social anxiety just try really hard to talk to someone long enough to exchange emailsnumberswhatever also if youre like me again you probably dont look particularly shy in fact you might look kind of antisocialintimidating so id suggest that you smile like crazy always consciously try to smile and dont be afraid to look like you dont know what you are doing if you need someone to practice talking with im here
my mothers father killed himself and any time she sees his belongings she cries she cries so deeply that it hurts my heart even though i didnt know him and i have no fatherly figure in my life her grief over him is not gone and it has been at least number years
if you dont want to live your life for yourself live it for the very people that you make such an effort to identify near note the homelessyou make note that there are many things that dont bring you joy or happiness but i would say you may very likely find joy and happiness through helping those very people dedicating your life to the betterment of those who are less fortunateyou have a very unique point of view and you make it clear that you realize that these problems tend to go unsolved but no one ever changed anything because they kill themselves they changed things because they lead the changeyour family doesnt know about your situation about your sadness because you dont communicate with them enough i daresay if they knew the fullest sense of your situation they would be there to support you in the best way they could but it seems you dont want to excuse to keep livingif you cant live your life for your own happiness if you feel once you die its all over then dont anxiety about your happiness ever again worry about making other people happy and maybe just maybe you will be the change that you so seemed to desire and in the process you might actually make yourself happyrobin williams is not a good example he was bipolar disorder and suffers from severe alcoholism he only recently got out of rehab only to fall right back into his drinking spells is not an excuse is not an example he just didnt understand his own anatomy enough to realize the damage he was doing to himselftake what you must from this im willing to discuss more but i figured i try to keep some big points in a simple manner in order to give you an easier opportunity to spot if you are still with ustake care and remember that if you cant be your own happiness then be someone elses that might just make you happy
your life situation is almost identical to mine except i deferred from collage twice and we cant get guns where i live i plan on seeing a physiatrist for the first time in number days just to see what kind of care i can get but i hold little hope because our health care is really bad here when i went to the place the first time i told them i was afraid i have schizophrenia because i was too afraid to tell the nurse i was feeling depression and suicidali think you should at least give a therapist or a psychiatrist a chance first before you proceed with your plannobody in the entire world right now knows how depression and suicidal i feel right now and only number or number people know im seeing a psychiatrist i also lied about why im seeing one to the people that know between now and then ive been writing a journal about what i feel right now and make a time stamp in the journal no matter what it is because ill probably get feeling nervous and forget everything when i walk into the psychiatrist office
yea i can understand that the cost of making it on your own anymore has gotten quite ridiculous i wish i could offer more help just take it one day at a time maybe try to find an activity you enjoy to help offer you some peace and tranquility day to day if i can direct my focus some where else my stupid brain has less time to think up crap and bring me down its obviously a band aid sort of thing you still want to fix the underlying problem but its the small things in life that make it worth waking up some daysi honestly believe youll come out all right from this thank the people that are happy to let you lean against them in your dark times im sure your mates are looking forward to seeing you prevail
yeah i think that animals understand people a lot sometimes more than other people as strange as this might sound i think your cat has been really great support to you i understand why you would love your cat so much thinking about suicide all the time does sound really exhausting and you mentioned having spasm which sounds really stressful to me has there been something in your life that has caused you to want to kill yourself
i feel exactly the same as you man feel like i wasted most of my life because of this asthenia disease in my case i dont think about the actual death part just the release sometimes you just have so much stuff going on and you feel so hopeless it just seems like the only option when its in fact not
thank you this seems hyperactive behavior it would be very helpful
always willing to listen and help when needed
i try to i just cant sometimes i carry a gun everywhere because i am that scared
i didnt think so either not then i hope it works out for you
its difficult when you feel like you should be happy but you just dont feel that way i think perhaps you should talk it out to someone who will listen to you not necessarily to give advice or to diagnose you but just to listen to you and be there for you you dont have to pretend anymore say it straight that you feel depression but you dont why and you cant stop feeling this way let your family know what youre going through
that was so very lovely to wake up to thank you so much
then maybe returningt there might be the first step you should be w the family of your choice not w people who clearly dont want the best for you you should take care of yourself for a while and while doing that maybe also put some distance between you and that girl it might help you to put things into perspective stay strong
thank you im trying to get ahold of a doctors note and the relevant medical records and my plan is basically just to camp out in the admin building until someone will at least answer my questions the more they shuffle me from department to department the more hopeless the whole thing seems i just i have a hard time seeing things clearly i suppose objectively you make so much sense about all of this but i cant bring myself to believe im not at fault i promise ill think long and hard about what you said though and at least try to bring things back into focus
i think talking to those you seek help from would be a good start but i see you said you cant afford it im sorry that your parents are also not supportive but why not seek your friends help i went to a few of them and explained to them what is going on and they were willing to listen sometimes being there for said friend that is also not feeling the best will help you build a stronger friendship where you are each others support can i ask how do you pain yourself
how you look has nothing to do with having a good time doing things
awesome that you are going to see someone for help can i deduce from your name that you want to become a voice actor
how i did it was i sat my loved one down said that i needed to have a serious discussion told them what has been on my mind and that i was constantly thinking about ending my life i asked for them not to try to argue with me over it but to instead just hold me while i cried surprisingly it helped me for that night the next day when the thoughts crept back into my mind i called them up and they knew what was up it was like having a support system
i know you dont know me and i dont know you but id be upset if you were no longer alive
a psych profile i once took indicated that i should be a farmer or truck driver i laughed back then but im not laughing anymore i envy you you found a better place you dont sound knowitall you sound like someone who finally managed to escape its good to know that can happen i feel so much better out there on the road or in the country i cant describe it but i feel like i can stretch one man traveling light free at lastso why dont i be a truck driver or farmer well truck drivers get tested understandable and unfortunate farmers need a farm and theres only one way left for me to buy one nowdepression is an intrinsic part of me like alcoholism it will never never go away that demon will always be there and nothing can make him go so i deal with it there are bad days and good days and the occasional really bad day like today its a familiar old piece of luggage that i can never get rid of and have to learn to live withperhaps like you ill find my way i certainly cant say i never will but it might not happen perhaps theres just tragedy coming i suppose all i can do is try to stay graceful and brave but its sooo hard sometimesim glad this place exists for those really bad times im glad you exist
yes you should talk to them anyone about these thoughts i have no doubt in my mind that people love you and care about you and would desperately want to talk to you if they knew this is how youre feeling i would also strongly advise you to get out of your head a little more when the thoughts start go and do something else build a model airplane watch a movie read a book call someone the solution is not in your head its in the world and you need to be in it experiencing it to see that
it made me smile because your second paragraph is exactly something my mom says thank you im tired sorry to hear about your spouse but it seems like you are looking more positively at it which is great thank you for the advice and good luck
whats bothering you you didnt indicate it in this thread have you been planning or thinking about suicide just take things one step at a time dont overstress yourself with trifle matters it still sunday and you can always call your friends or family for any advice and help you may need
is there anything you think you can do or have tried to do about it what do you mean when you say you cant have anything you want that youre always wrongwere here to support you i hope we all hope you feel better
i wish you posted more on what lead you all the way to the tracks to kill yourself im also not that happy with life but never actively sought out a way out please let me know whats bothering you how did things get the way they are hope to lend an ear on this lonely valentines daybest regards
im sorry about your dad i lost my favorite uncle when i was number i am now number but for a few years i really struggled with his death what happened was i closed myself up and didnt talk to anyone about it i really downward spiraled and shit and i questioned life itself and how could such a nice funny warmhearted individual just suddenly die like that basically i realized that after number years of feeling depressed negative and just overall like shit i was tired about it also during that time my grades suffered i dropped out of community college and had no real direction in life one day i just broke down to my mom and started bawling my eyes out and i cried for fucking ours just babbling on and on and all she did was sit there and listen to me after this i felt a lot better i dont know why but i felt like i released all of these emotions and this feeling unhappy building up inside me sorry for the fuckin essay ha anyways you could always join the military get free travel join a brotherhood get in good shape and get worldly experiences for a year or two and get paid to do it if you chose the right route in the military you could come out with some actual experience to apply to a job afterwards idk for me military would be my option if my current plan goes south i know that this toatally sounds like an ad for the military or something haha sorry
i do tooand yeah i understand what you irritable mood about just dying but not over being depressed mood or cause you hate life or whatever its kinda hyperactive behavior a feeling thats just sitting there and you want to follow it but have no idea why its even crossing your mind most of the time at least for me thats how it is
number you are not a fuckup and certainly not the biggest fuckup on the planet number it will be okay number theres no reason to hate yourself number it will be okay number you deserve a way out number i promise itll be okay number if shes late it could be any number of things i stopped getting my period for a time altogether when i was number my mom was sure i was pregnant even though i wasnt having sex at the time i ended up having a condition that affected my cycle its possible anything could delay her cycle stress illness or hell just her maturing more and her cycle switching gears it happens listen to these fine folks around who are suggesting planned parenthood theres every possibility that shes not pregnant and if she is then there are options i know it looks hyperactive behavior it but this isnt the end of the world i promise it will be okay be safe
i hope you are reading this people do care
i know how difficult it is to sit there and watch the days pile up oh look its another day where i didnt do anything the more the days go by the harder it gets the first thing you need to do is forgive yourself
it began for me when i was twelve or thirteen from what i know its just because youre maturing
i dont usually comment on these things as most of the time others have already said what i already would have but please do us the favor of not going through with it nobody really wants to see you in ache there are just some out there who chest pain hyperactive behavior you and feel hyperactive behavior causing you ache would solve their own problems it is a dark place to be in but i really hope you get out of it
my current state pretty horrible lonliness worthlessness pathetic tired hopeless im in college the only people i have talked to here are two girls i know and have known for a while they really dont care they would say they do but they dont text me to check up call or honestly even try to make plans we talk infrequently i have made a lot of acquaintances hundreds in fact due to my personality i am both an introvert and extrovert and am quite good at making friends i think the reason i am so good at making friends is because i put everything i have into being there for people because i dont want them to feel the lonliness i have felt all of my lifei can relate to you in multiple ways im seventeen a musician have a fair share of acquaintances and you are the way you are for other peoplei think this can explain why a lot of people who are depressed moodanxious are ophthalmia sympathetic towards others due to their understanding of how one can feel when they are lonely can i ask about your intentions with your phobia social status and presence in your college i think this can help with why you feel these things since they might be an effect of unmet expectations i do feel happy occasionally these are times when i forget everything and there are only a few times when i do watching a humorous television show hyperactive behavior the office or the big bang theory any show really just listening to a story different than mine is what makes me feel better playing on stage ive been a musician for about ten years now im number and when i hypersomnia i hypersomnia a lot it helps me forget the happiness i feel is happy its just that the number of times in my day when i am genuinely happy is much smaller than the average person clinically depressed mood people do get happy just not ofteni think youd be surprised as to how similar we are and that not everyone is as happy as they seemone friend i had in middle school well call him brian was a great buddy of mine who was fun to hang out with and always willing to stop by one day im hanging out at his house and were playing halo together he suddenly says hey man i appreciate it that you came overfor sure man its always fun hanging out hereyoure not going to leave are youuh not yet its only number o clono thats not what i meanhe started to tweak out for a couple of seconds and i was a little scared but then he saidare you going to stay my friendyeah man why wouldnt ihe didnt say anything and not long after i went home after his mom swooped in took me away and took me homelater i found out that he was taking very serious anxiety mental depression medicine as he suffers from very extreme panic attacks attacks as a result he was teased a lot in elementary school for it and he stayed home weeks after weeks due to a stomach fluone of the most jovial funniest confident guys i know everybody has their tweaks flaws personal dilemnas when i see how people arent so different i feel better myself im not quite sure what the second paragraph is saying are you asking me whether or not i think my diagnoses was false or are you saying if i think its a sort of placebo where they told me i am and i am not figuring our why the way it works is you talk about your life and how you feel and they tell you medically whther or not they think you have a mood disorder then sometimes they do some biological testsnot exactly as strong as you put it im asking if it influenced or tipped your ideas as to what might be going on if you were looking for that ive talked with psychiatrists and theyve prescribed wellbutrin for anxiety mental depression and focus its proven somewhat effective thinking back how i behaved and thought beforeim only asking this question through the perspective of somebody who doesnt know what clinical mental depression is exactly im taking the side of whoever is giving the information to me on this thread not the skeptical sidethank you for responding by the way

ive been suicidal for the past number days and ive had a similar experience in some aspects to me the problem is that most people respond by talking about how it would affect those around you and the response is but its my life and i need a reason to keep goingmy experience has been one of pain leading to emptiness and i suppose a lack of purpose rather than a lack of meaning for the past number days its been oh ill keep going until that new insert filmgamebookalbumnew thing comes out and then ill do it theres always been something but there always hasnt been anything after the last thingfrom my knowledge and experience suicide is an extreme response to extreme pain and so the way to deal with it is to remove or at the least lessen the pain that is after all the general reason behind suicide its just that all other options should be thoroughly exausted firsti try to distract myself immerse myself in things try and feel as good as i still can suicide is on the horizon but theres something nice thats more immediate the ways of dealing with that kind of pain is rather specific to the individual but i game a lot as a distraction i immerse myself in reading books watching films or shows listening to music id recommend trying lots of things and trying to multitask as much as possible when things are bad im frequently playing a game while watching a show while pondering philosophy i find that if you clog up you mind with nice stuff it stops the pain for a whileid also recommend trying to meet new people something where continued contact is worth hanging around for ive found a certain kind of confidence at the worst of times holding your life in your weakness of hand gives you a fair amount of power id also recommend contacting a suicide hotline specific to where you live when things are really badfrom what i gather from the tone of your post its a thought out and reasoned thing my hope and i suppose request as a fellow sufferer is to make sure that as many of the alternate painrelief options have been tried first and to hold survive as the primary goal for each day you make it to the end youve done well i hope that at least some of this has been of help
thanks man i appreciate it i dont have much friends so whenever i feel down i go on reddit i appreciate all of you guys i been in a horrid mood

with regard to number number think about how bad your injuries would have to be to make you feel as bad physically as you actually do emotionally is it a bruise a few scratches a small fracture a broken limb severed limbs gushing blood and exposed internal organs that would make eli roth vomit if youre seriously considering ending it and people could see physically what youre going through mentally there would be tears there would be fainting and there would be surgeons working round the clock the ache is real dont tell yourself you need to suck it up just because other people cant see it

i just feel like killing myself is the only way i can have control over my own lifeit would be my decision
im not entirely sure what you mean background i have major depressive disorder and have struggled with it increasingly pervading my life for the last five years
thats just it its not the heroin im good at its living the shitty street life of a junkie that i am good at im having such a miserable time trying to adjust to real sedentary life i feel like a constant outsider and it kills mei liked the symbol of strength that keeping it gave me for this last year or so but now that i realized how easy it would be to fill it up with cleaning products its haunting me i didnt think about the recognition like that at all though i think it just gave me the push i need to stick around at least for another day thank you
its a pleasure i wish you the best
maybe im not sure honestly its an interesting thought but as a freshly minted number year old whos trying to overcome a phobia social of driving and just found a second job i worked at a factory a few months before being laid off uprooting is a hard thought for the moment besides i doubt theres anything out there in the world for me i died a long time ago
i have a friend that has told me similar stories she would tell me that shed lock herself in her soon and avoid knives because she was afraid of depressed mood herself and other people like an overwhelming sensation to go stab abnormal behavior had washed over her shed sit trapped in her room for over a week sometimes i never got that it isnt something i personally ever experienced maybe its a female thingi cant really tell from what you said what is the cause of your sadnessmfw my friends dont know shit about how much i want to kill myselfif you cant talk to your friends and comfort each other in hard times than maybe theyre not the quality of friends that deserve youmfw i literally got told at my party by someone that they dont respect me because im still a virginfuck em no not literally thats one depressed mood close minded person look i dont want to trivialize this for you but youre only number not only that but youre not a guy society views virgin females with a much more forgiving eye than males trust me guys are outcast from the human species if theyre still virgins after number all because depressed mood media and brain dead sheeples making mountains out of nothingsi would stop broadcasting it to everyone though its a personal thing and sadly because its a topic of fierce scrutiny a secretive thing the only person you should ever tell is the guygirl youve been dating and becoming close with if they have feelings for you they wont care that goes for number number number year old virgins as well the people that matter dont caremfw someone was really depressed mood at my party and every time i saw them i wanted to stab myself and scream because i wasnt allowed to show myself not having a good time because then people will just assume im being a jealous bitchits surprising hearing about a depressed mood person throwing parties im not gonna do the others im starting to feel hyperactive behavior max dose of anti depressants could be the problem just hyperactive behavior they recommend getting a numbernd opinion with your health issues so to should they for mental health issues i think its pretty clear these anti depressants arent working and could even be compounding the problem i cant guarantee that they are but it may be worth talking to your doc about it or a different doc altogether also and i was apprehensive about typing this it seems some how to me that youre maybe slowly realizing the things you thought were important in drug abuse school are slowly revealing themselves to be the true petty bullshit things that they really were the real world hits a lot of people hyperactive behavior well hyperactive behavior the world came drug withdrawal syndrome down on you seeking the attention and acceptance of crappy people putting on a fake mask for those around you not losing your virginity at number all crap im probably grasping at the few straws you gave me but it seems hyperactive behavior your just slowly coming to terms with that waving bye to an old life and not knowing much about forging a new one but the old ways are familiar ways pthpthtp maybe im just blowing hot air by this point anyway i truly wish you the best i hope you can find that unseen rope in the dark and pull yourself out of the stinky hole one last thing males are easy im one i know dont just give it to any irritable mood that sees you as a challenge or a conquest because he found out your a virgin save revealing that to them till later dates find someone that loves you first not loves taking your virginity theres a difference number is a person of quality the other is a shit ball douchiefruit that will brag about it to his bros and kick you to the curb when hes done with you dont be afraid to pm people here and strike up a convo probably not so much with me since as you might have guessed we dont have a lot to relate to lol maybe kate though you guys could pwnt noobs in free internet games hyperactive behavior tfnumber or dota or whatever try to have a little fun day to day it really helps i hope things start looking brighter
i dont know you or your situation but i invite you to consider whether your family would be sad confused angry and devastated if you were to end your own lifewhat family my workaholic father that has no time for me or my mother thats dying of malignant neoplastic disease and bedridden more days than not oh or how about my siblings that were all adopted at or near birth so they never grew up with me so they have no attachment to mei hate to be a negative nancy and i know it sounds like im shooting you down for trying to help to be honest i appreciate the attempt but mentioning friendsfamily just reminds me how alone i really am
im here for you as long as you need me i know exactly what you irritable mood when you say the knowledge that you could kill yourself whenever you wanted is a relief at least theres a back up sort of thing but you do matter your problems matter to me because when i asked for help you were there to provide it and thats more than i can say for most people i know
i was posting this as a i know how to get through it you can talk to me kind of thing im doing fine thank you for your concern p
not the same for everyone many people say it goes away just have to give it time though the majority of people i have spoken to all say the same thing treatable but not curable
i have been suicidal since i was number had ptsd since i was number had eating disorder since early childhood and anxiety disorder since around age number and at some point i developed personality disorder im number i got some counseling when i was number when i was numbernumber and again when i was number i tried zoloft when i was number but got to stop because adverse effects i needed to go illness leave when i was number i didnt kill myself because of my siblings but didnt want to live i was hospitalized more than half of year between ages numbernumber i tried medicines for my physical and mental illnesses until we finally managed to get all components under control last fall i was number then i fought financial aid for my first real theraphy when i was number and it all finally worked for my depression this summer im still going to theraphy to fix these other disorders i got but i have never felt like this so sometimes there is hope
i really dont think its that limited ive lived in number countries and number cities number of which were tired large ive dated many girls but the closest i found still wasnt actually that close i dont support the cultures for the topics i want to participate in even if my life turned around would it really be worth the effort it all ends in death anyway why not just skip all the shitty times sure i am also skipping the good times but i wont remember those when im dead either i dont think the world cares about what i have to contribute and i base that on putting my heart and soul into my work for the last number years and a handful of people care about my work but they dont care about meit seems like everyone is in a relationship just for themselves in the past my most trusted friends turned on my for some girl i dated and then things ended they had known me for years her for months they picked her over me i want to give a girl a lot of support i want to be there for her and have her there for me but whenever i show weakness the girls hate it its like every single girl i meet with out exception wants some douche bag boyfriend who doesnt take anything seriously is it really that hard to ask for a decently intelligent conversation why cant people handle a single moment of criticism with out feeling attacked why cant people understand that instant gratification leads to failure in the long term why cant people realize that fucking each other over leads to a less successful long term why cant the world just fucking work together
i cant imagine how much it sucks to have no bearing and to have oversight of the huge dissagreance in america to a foreigner like me it really does seem like a place of extremes what rift is between your father and best friend
first know that many many people have felt the way you feel and worse and have managed to come through it and put it behind them who knows how long it will take but it is possiblenow imagine how valuable this experience will be when you finally make it through i dont know how old you are but imagine another fifty or sixty years of a life in which you will be able to call on this experience to help other people through their own suicidal thoughtsyou do not deserve this and im not going to tell you its a blessing in disguise or anything but you can turn it to your advantage your life is an enormous resource and throwing it away only seems winwin in the short term you have so much potential to do good in the world
i get extremely stress out in retail or fast food jobs due to having anxiety i have more issues with getting a job because i was arrested for shoplifting a few months ago any retail job is almost impossible for me to get and i just cant deal with working with food im not a tired desirable person to hire

my uncle committed suicide in numberi was born in numberi had to deal with my mom freaking out every time i didnt call home on time because that meant id killed myselfand the fact that she figured by the time you hit number youve seen twice what you need to see since her brother died at numberbecause my fucking uncle who died number years before i was even born couldnt hack harvardsuicide is a dick move youre fucking up the lives of people who arent even living yet

i was number when i was arrested wasnt a good student or a good offspring but i really turned myself around my last two years of high school i still got suspended two more times for doing stupid things but thats just life as cheesy as it sounds whatever doesnt kill you just makes you stronger and i think that because you are still young you will have plenty of chances to screw up and try to better yourself i would actually encourage doing more stupid things because they make for good stories later in life and they allow you do look back at what kind of person you were and give advice to people who happen to be in similar situations also when the time does come around for you to help someone you will see that this mistake that you made getting arrested is actually what is helping you help your friend not gonna lie youre gonna feel terrible over and over again sometimes you will lie in bed running through the arrest over and over again in your head and think about what you could have done or said to get out of it where you went wrong in life but you will eventually accept that it happen and move oni encourage you to pm me so that we can talk more
with that attitude youll never break through it you got to understand that if theres no hope nothing else matters you can make it through this nothing last forever i understand how bad life sucks and just because you have an illness dosnt make you worthless
needing help isnt pathetic maybe what you think youre doing wrong is just her wishing you would reach out
hello and happy holidays almost no one likes to be alone if you can family is usually people you can hang around with theyre better than nothingim not sure if this applies where you live but there are often public events for christmas celebrations if youd hyperactive behavior to go to one of those perhaps it would help you to get your ex off your mind breakups happen to many people all the time the only thing to do is accept the reality and plough through what has happened send me a message if youd hyperactive behavior im free to talk to for approximately numberh
honestly man ive been there the best solution possible is to forget girls for a while for the cant get my mind off her thing thats always a little tricky find something that takes complete interest for you preferably not music because that usually just ignites thought of the missed person and just completely let it take hold of you for me a few months ago it was books and helping my friend with his video game walkthrough channel on youtube i just helped him edit the audiovisual and i stopped thinking about the girl for you what it seems like is youre confiding your life and happiness way too much into another person you need to find the love for life for yourself and by yourself eventually youll find that girl whos meant for you but you need to work on yourself first and stop putting so much of your heart into another people dont give too much of yourself to somebody too fast
please dont do it im sure that there is someone out there who can help you you may not believe it but im sure many more people then you think will be upset if you were to commit suicide please dont
im on new medication and have been seeing a new therapist these past couple months so theres that thanks for your kind words
better idea keep riding your bike and dont stoptheres a scene in gattaca where two brothers swim out to sea and one brother is significantly stronger than the other and every time they do this he winsthe idea is to swim as far out as you can before you get scared and swim backwhen the asthenia brother wins the stronger asks howhe said that he didnt think about the swim backif you end up killing yourself anyway it makes no difference but at least try just driving for miles where you havent beenmaybe youll find something youve been missing
dont apologize its okay and im glad youre seeing things differently
no need to apologize violence wont solve any of the problems that ineedareason is having chances are it will make them worse violence is never the answer inflicting harm to another human being is a terrible thing
we all remember the bad over the good but im sure your friends would stand by you if you needed them as to your parentswellyoure not going to have to be around them forever so hang on and youll be free within a few years i would of thought dont let them win eh
angry is appropriate shit doesnt make sense i understand thatits not apathy though anger means you want something not nothingi encourage you to make decisions often i feel like i cant do anything like i dont have a choice but you do make the decision to walk somewhere and back to read a book to watch a movie it helps i promise
you should walk in put the phonecomputer away and do it yes im afraid because as i said whenever i try it just ends up as pointlessness im afraid to try anything im afraid to go through with anything for fear that it wont accomplish anything and that if it does the person that sees it hears it judges it whatever will laugh or dismiss it for someone elses work thats better as per previous recurrences of such a thing or theyll patronize me and act like its really good but just not good enough
i respect your ideals on the subject but in our culture its not accepted because we are selfish as well for the same bigoted reasons that jack kevorkian was seen as a anger instead of a hero i more see this situation as not a imminent painful terminal disease however things that his patients suffered the only disease you are suffering is that of the bane of mankind and all it seems to lack the only reason it is lacking is because you are not fulfilling all that it can be i know youre not looking for the advice on how to stay or be happy but its all too common that life passes through the fingertips due to a lack of push to push your life to its full potential i hope you see the good thats in you
and the fact that you say i guess means youre not sure this is a permanent solution to what can be a temporary problem
but that advice you gave wasnt always valid nowhere did i say it was it was advice for exactly one person one person who clearly was not considering his situation rationally yet was considering his behavior rational the key to such situations is to illuminate the irrationality of that behavior i even gave examples of when it might be rational yet you steadfastly refuse to see thisi feel like itd be pretty rational ill consider doing an xpost shortlyive already seen some of your situation you have professional training you have a daughter you have a whole lot to live for it is not rational to conflate im in a shitty job market with i should just kill myselfwhat you said was untrue no matter who you said it towhat i said was youre not thinking rationally thats as true as true can be when a numberyearold with a viable social network says i have no future it is not a rational statement ill say for the umpteenth time there are rational times to contemplate suicide i delineated a few in my response my advice to the op was that his situation was not rational yet you keep saying thats not true for me and its not true always shitso let me reiterate this entire thread is a fullstop allhandsondeck attempt by every interested and disinterested party to influence the behavior of the submitter thats not you thats not anyone else and its anything but universal i stand number behind everything i said and i stand number behind the notion that were you to commit suicide it would not be a rational act eitherbut im not going to continue to debate here in this thread whether or not what i wrote for him makes sense for you because right here right now this isnt about youyou wanna make it about you submit something until then go pester someone else
i really just want to know how be happy again
depression and anxiety
no life is accidental especially not yours i want so much for you to live i want you to get away from those poisonous people i want you to start seeing a psychologist avoid a psychiatrist if you can they seem more interested in doling out pills than giving you real skills to combat your negative thoughts i want you to accept and love yourself for who you are i want you to get through this and come out the other side think of all the young people in similar situations that you can help you are not alone you are beautiful please dont end your life
most people that work at hotlines are volunteers who arent paid they do it not for a paycheck but because they care about you as a human beingplease give them a chance they really do care about you
sorry to hear about that a broken relationship can really be one of the worst experiences it sounds like you really love herits important to remember that you deserve that same love from yourself as strongly as you feel she doesnt determine your self worth only you cana relationship can destroy you but you dont have to let it every one of them ends eventually and you come out stronger and more experienced for it that will benefit you when you eventually heal the wounds and find another person who you love dearly
thats good youve got people who are close to you even just relating to her problems may make you feel better and her as well i just hope you dont keep it to yourself even if it means using reddit
ive been hospitalized number times each time it has been just expensive babysitting im not putting myself though it again
ill also be moving out of my hometown in a couple months to go to university and even though i feel really sad about leaving my friends and my family im looking forward to it i want to start a new life by myself ive moved out of town a couple of times before and ive left great friends but let me tell you it can always be better than it was before yes i admit its sometimes hard to start over and make new friends ive been through all of it but its not impossible and you can always keep in touch with everyone and everything over the internet i hope it helps you in some way
i fell in love with a beautiful person someone who was there for me and wanted to walk with me through all the difficult timesim amazed a depression person can actually find a romantic partner who tolerates and helps i have a couple online friends i can confess to but maybe not enough to really get me out of myself i get the sense that people generally only want to see me happy or dead and that im insufferable otherwisei may be mistaken but remember reading that one of the big dating sites that makes you take a personality test does not offer matches for anyone who scores too high on depression that depression people have to go it alone and heal themselves before love is even possible probably true for most
please dont take that step i really really hope that you dont i probably still dont get how much your life sucks but i still feel that you should go on loving people care about you people who want to help please just stay and talk
most run away from it though and i do talk to my dad he was the person i asked if i should get on a pill for it or not
besides the number kgs those things are all common at almost everyone of your age i am quite sure the drug abuse weight is your main goal of fixing and when that is accomplished you feel so much better the other problems wont suddenly be so terrible any morei know you can do this you would have to spend some time doing exercise etc but it will be worth it youre number only just beginning life do it now while you are young
even if i had insurance to actually see a therapist i probably wouldnt go not only because the idea of it scares me but ive heard of many bad experiences with therapy id be afraid of being locked away or somethingi tried taking small steps to help my anxiety mental depression last year instead of taking online college classes hyperactive behavior i usually do i enrolled in on campus courses the first day of school i ended up having a huge panic attacks attack and i almost blacked out i cancelled my classes the next day
if talking isnt working then you need to try something else why not try saying this isnt working for me to a doctor and see what other options are available
i do so out of compulsion i have episodes of intense negative emotions that turn into violent hatred of myself and i end up uncontrollably digging my fingernails into my skin until i start bleeding i guess i do it because i cant think of any other way to vent how i feel or calm myself downi never self harmed until a year ago i dont enjoy doing it its just something that happens during those episodes
two things have stood out to methe friends i have reached out to wanted to help with best intentions but they see me as a lost cause and dont really want me to bring them down anymore sounds hyperactive behavior the mental depression talking did they say things hyperactive behavior that or are you just assuming because its your defaulti just want to hide and cancel becausehes just going to be yet another person that i let down i know that all too well everyone is different and everyone deserves to be treated as such dont assume they will let you down imagine someone feeling hyperactive behavior that about youdepression will fight back your urge to trust people with fake facts and flawed logic keep fighting you will meet good people and you probably already know some dont let mental depression cloud your judgement of them let people in again you deserve the love that comes with trust
dont be so hard on yourself man ive lived on my own for only like five months and im number it is extremely expensive to do that sort of thing nowadays back in the day you used to be able to build a house out of logs and a guy your age could have number kids already nowadays many are lucky to buy a house by the time they are numberdont get all tied up in with this society it will burn you out it doesnt care about who you are inside it just cares with what you can do mechanical laborbe ok with taking some time for yourself stop dating for a while be ok with taking some time to relax you are too wound up you arent going to find happiness by doing things no matter how big the check list or how many things you check off that does not necessarily mean you will have lived a tired successful lifeinstead take some time to get to know yourself when you lay down to have a nap dont completely go to sleep just rock back and forth a little bit to barely stay away and just feel yourself in the bed just be aware you are there and keep doing that over and over again feelings will come to you and thoughts will come to you but you will become more aware of them just really feel them and get to understand themyou can change how everything is the reason you have all these girls cheat on you is because you cannot see them for how they are youre not able to see their real values youre not able to see who they are by just looking into their eyestake some time and read some philosophy from ancient greece appreciate some fine art read wikipediaits ok to take time if you just go out there again like a wild animal you will be in a wild chaotic abyss of angst fear and listlessness
that sounds pretty devastating can you not return at all ie youve been kicked out permanently or you can go back in a year not a particularly pleasant experience sure but it gives you a chance to take time out to sort stuff outi wont try and play things down having big setbacks in life is horrible but it doesnt have to be the endyou are lucky to have such good relationships and people who care about you and you are obviously a considerate person youve at least thought a bit about the impact your death would have by your desire to choose a less violent method yes avoid trainsbtw i hyperactive behavior your thing with the dieresis on suxcnumberxafcide thats cute sounds hyperactive behavior you know a bit about linguistics maybe you could go into teaching english one day you dont necessarily need a college degreeif you have been doing poorly in studies is there a reason perhaps spending a bit too much time on the societies depression general lack of motovation or do you have an undiagnosed learning disorder if youre just finding the course too hard maybe you can speak with your tutors to get extra helphave you confided in your friends and family how distressed youre feeling
i can understand why it would be hard to talk about if its tabooyeah when no one is listening its easy to feel ignored i dont really know what all youve done but i do know that its hard to meet new people i also kind of feel the same way that were all alone in the world but i think thats why we need each other sometimes its hard to feel alone all the timeokay take care until then

hey thatxcnumberxbnumbers a long time to feel shit how about not killing yourself and start doing something you love play those games but just stay alive your family does love you you can start a new life everyday
its really fucked that your parents would say they dont want to live with you everyone under the roof needs to put in the effort to create a nice home environment school just tends to suck for painfully shy people there are people like you but they dont go to your school they are alone at other schools if no one wants you you cant blame them or ask them to change your mind you can maybe hope that they will see how they were wrong about you they would need to see that through your actions i didnt have any friends when i was in school and if i could tell number year old me one thing it would be focus on improving yourself give people a reason to like you do things that make being you appealing to you it sucks that loneliness is so powerful but it is im sorry about everything
i know the easiest way to die to die of old age giving up is not what you really want to do you came here for support because there is a part of you that doesnt want this think about that part and dont give in to the other side the suicidal side
playing the game helps me kind of escape life if im particularly sad i can always just go play dota and ill end up a lot happier its one of the few things that distracts me in such a way that i barely feel the ache whilst playing
even though your anxiety is inside and not visible doesnt mean that its not illness no one expects people to function as normal when they are physically ill and no one should when the illness is invisible be kind to yourself you are doing more than i could for most of my life i sometimes sound like a broken rocord here when i ask have you gotten professional help i dont ask it because its normal thing to ask but because for me it helped so im asking that from you too
i dreamt of becoming a football player every since i could kick a ball it was a thing i did every day for at least number years i generally loved it more than anything but whats the point in doing it if i cant make a living out of it one day if i chose to live i may end up in a nice apartment maybe a partner who actually understands me and doesnt call me childish or shout at me when im acting inappropriately in public im in a circle which is i cant be with people if i dont know how to act socially and i cant learn how to act socially if i cant be with people its a circle ive been in for years i may end up having a friend and a career but it will just mask what i want in life the only thing that has helped me was a superman comic a fictional character but now the affect of that has gone if i was good at one fucking thing then i may stay around and have hope that one day i can reach my goal but no no skills in fucking anything to help me its not fair everyone can make friends do well at things have a nice life but it has always been fucking me im sorry for all the other adhd autistic aspergers suffers hope you all do well in life but you have lost a team member it was too much for me and i must go thanks for your help and i appreciated it even if it was for a day that someone i believed cared for me thank you
its easy the answer is guilt they really dont give a fuck but dont want to be held responsible later so if theres a risk of suicide they get involved after the threat is over they typically move away emotionally and place a lot of distance between you and themselves if they genuinely cared they would know that distance does little to help then again if they really cared it may not have gotten to the point of suicide in the first place
that sounds tired frustrating especially since quitting a job or asking for days off is not an option for most people it doesnt sound like its much of an option for you
im new to reddit i never thought about suicide but i have had some pretty shitty thoughts sometimes to me it looks like u need a fresh start go to college and have fun there are loans you can do with out a co signer be happy day by dayfind a hobbie sweat it out with exercise focus on the little things that make you happy make those things a big part of your life girls will come and go doesnt matter what you look like if you think your the bombcom others will too give the universe what u want in return i know its hard but you will prevaili like to make a list of what i want in life and go for it little by little now go play a video game smell or fart under a cover watch a good moviei hope this helps you seem pretty fuckin awesome to me
im going to suggest you reach out to rainn wwwrainnorg they can offer you some guidance here what he did was rape you did not deserve that you did nothing wrong its not your fault please reach out to someone consider therapy maybe if you just feel hyperactive behavior you want to rant and vent about it my inbox is always open i know what youre going through im so sorry this happened to you but it doesnt have to ruin you youre a survivor
no one knows they can help but no one can fix you but by asking help to that task you can get better its not easy but can be worth it
youre right it is a difficult conversation to have i feel the same way youre also right that they dont look at you in the same way thats why you should find a strangerwhether it be a therapist or your local bartender and just talk there are powerful things about the act of speaking that we cant begin to understand so find someone whether its someone you know or a stranger off the streets and then talk but the stranger or the friend might not want you talking to them so find a willing listener
hey brother youre not a sad little bitch youre an alcoholic which means these mood swings are normal it comes with the territory a formerengineering student that plays guitar hmm i bet you would be pretty cool to hang out with interesting to talk to just thinking out loud i understand what youre going through and while i obviously dont know your circumstances i get the feelings though i am not exactly qualified to give advice and no songs are popping into my mind at the moment but i want to let you know that you are most likely a worthwhile person just extrapolating from what youve said and how you write its in my best interest to keep people like you around on this rock eh sorry to hear about the family friend and good luck dude focus on the guitar getting into the flow is just as good as any drug
please know that youre not alone i feel like this so often it feels like itll never go away as though im permanently stuck with it i dont know where the end is for you or for me but what i knowor atleast strongly believe is that suicide isnt the end for either of us or for anyone you are strong and beautiful and important life deals really shitty weakness of hand sometimes the best people are torn down by their own thoughts i wish so badly i could be there with you to tell you its okay because i feel we are so similar from your post things feel hopeless right now like theres no light at the end of the tunnel but there is i mean there has to be people like us cant go through really hard times for nothing please hold onyou are meant for amazing things im sorry things are so rough right now it hurts my heart that great people like you have to feel like this please if you ever need to talk about anything feel free to message me
petty stuff i need to organize and clean i have books i want to read i can barely get myself started because of the anxiety mental depression
nojust nothere is no way your life is meaningless let alone void of romance do you not read your own words why are you looking for something you already possessxenumberxnumberxnumbercthe problem often not discovered until late in life is that when you look for things in life hyperactive behavior love meaning motivation it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock the most successful people in life recognize that in life they create their own love they manufacture their own meaning they generate their own motivation for me i am driven by two main philosophies know more today about the world than i knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others youd be surprised how far that gets you neil degrasse tysons response on reddit when asked what can you tell a young man looking for motivation in life itself i remember clearly that ama some months ago i think it was last month actually and reading through his responses to various questions thinking to myself after browsing for a solid twenty minutes that neil degrasse tyson isnt some scientist wrapped in his own shrewd world voided of anything beyond data and facts the man exudes romance in of himself but why is he relevant to your post he advocates not looking for satisfaction elsewhere beyond oneself isnt that an amazing philosophy for the longest time i thought that happiness was out there under a rock somewhere or maybe in an hour glass figure donning a red dress or perhaps even in a homecooked lasagna meal it isnt mate i wont pretend to think i am an expert on happiness hyperactive behavior spinoza socrates seneca montaigne etc was but i do know however that happiness is the endall to any type of suffering its funny because ive talked to homeless people who are seemingly the happiest people ever yet they possess nothing beyond a few trinkets and a shopping cart i know that anybody posting in sw is looking for some kind of response some indication that their words not only are part of an cathartic experience but an omen for mistakes to be avoided thats damn kind of you man i irritable mood it i think it takes courage to post something especially to admit that one lacks an inability to be happy yet desperately striving for it there are doers and there are talkers youre a doer youve been doing youve been successful in so many more ways than youre giving yourself credit and i think thats where the problem lies you arent giving yourself enough creditthere is always meaning in life check this video outurl might question the relevancy of the video in my response and your message think though of what the mother is doing and think of how sedated state her child is compared to the screams of other children in the ambiance can you imagine what during those precious moments of time the mother is thinking shes not thinking about financial woes flatulence prices mortgage payments college tuition of her children clothing being stained or that theres even an earthquake going on shes preserving the smile on her son and you my good sir cant ever let that smile fade away because there are so many damn people depending on that smile that smile of yours is an indication that the world is safe full of opportunity and bountiful that damn fine much needed smile of yours propels more people in their life than you thinklike the mother dont let peoples smiles fade because they cant see yours show the entire world that youve reason to live and they wont ever have a reason not to be bad assand if you cant seem to come to any solace give me a call ill dance with you seriously ive an entire tmnt costume set that ill wear and dance to it just for you mate boooooooooooooooom lets do this hotcakes
jesus you still have it after two years ive never taken more than numberwell except one time when somebody slipped it to menumber is a lot
necessary disclaimer this is not a diagnosis people with symptoms similar to yours often have a real recognised mental disorder that deserves as much sympathy care and good treatment as any other illness and it also deserves no stigma or shame not functioning properly is even a key diagnostic criterion for serious mental disorder if it were the case that you had this again no diagnosis here your school is obligated to give you proper medical allowance so you are able to get better noone should have to suffer through this alone
break the cycle first step instead of watching depressed mood tv watch something you enjoy when im down i love to watch my favorite show community anyway im feeling down i find the episode i can most identify with and watch it i laugh and i feel not so alone in the world watch some comedy specials donald glovers weirdo is great and available on youtube its hard to just work out or read a book dont do something just so you can tell people you did it do something that youll actually enjoy thats the first step
it may have been a cheesy joke or something that just floppedlike what if he meant to imply something like that youll be a new man by the time you leave the class leaving the old behind or shedding the old you as if to put it to death or that the class is highly difficult and stressful as to bring one to their wits end artists can have a flair for such dramatic prose just a wild guess i do think its unlikely that hed actually mean what he said literally but even if he did think of what kind of person it would take to actually say that in such a situation is that the kind of person whose opinion youd weigh your life on the answer either way is to keep it up and dont forget to enjoy it
i appreciate your concern and your reply it is my family i want to move far away but my mom is nausea if i ventricular dysfunction left or died no one would take care of her its not fair to her but sometimes i wonder if someday things will get better for me im single guys use me then leave every timeso i just kinda gave up i went to college out of state so my friends are spread across the country i had a friend here since we were number but a few months back she told me i was too sensitive to be around i was recently diagnosed as bipolar disorder i try not to be sensitive but sometimes i cannot help it i just want things to get better i just got a big promotion this week i was so excited i tried telling my dad about it and he walked out of the house mid sentence i was getting through fathers day well enough until my sister called my momshe has a hard of hearing so her volume was turned up she said its hard to be around me because i smell bad i spent all day at her house yesterday literally number am to number pm cleaning her house and helping babysit her one week old so she could hypersomnia and go to a wedding just for her to complain it sucks i know im overreacting so i understand if this post is just obnoxious i tried killing myself when i was a sophomore in college because my dad refused to speak with me because i wouldnt play intermural sp basketball and i was deep in mental depression as it was i know how dark it can get i know what its hyperactive behavior to be a mental patient i thought maybe foolishly my dad would love me after that it just made him even more angry itll be fine im sure just nausea of everything
do you honestly way deep down believe your friends would do that
do not be sorry i understand that feeling completely i was actually engaged and called it off last summer to a great guy and went through all these emotionsfeelings again it is tired difficult for sure pm me if you need i will be around might be later today but i am extremely willing to listen you have my support
try to get help trough nhs go to see your gp and she can refer you to specialist
im the worst to give advice butyoure sooooo young friend i wanted to die for a multitude of reasons when i was number so glad i held out youll meet somebody else and then wonder how it is that another person can have so much sway over your heart in the blink of an eye hold on itll pass i tried when i was number and failed when i hit my early twenties it was like the clouds parted youre day will come just gotta make it through this ruff patch so many paths ahead of you
im really glad you shared this suicide isnt a oneperson story a person may end their own personal narrative when they die but that doesnt irritable mood that person doesnt continue to have an effect on the lives of others i didnt read your post as an attempt to convince anyone of anything youre just sharing your own personal experience with suicide and how its impacted your life it was honest i dont think you can ask for much more i dont know if there are any subs for people who have lost loved ones to suicide but there really ought to be i know there are support groups in the real world you probably already know this at least logically but whatever your ex chose to do wasnt your fault say it again it was not your fault suicide is such an intensely personal decision its arguably one of the most personal decisions a person can make it wasnt your fault thanks again for sharing your story
sure what exactly is the topic pm me if needed
im going to write books and get better at coding or improving process flows at work i love improving processes to get the job done faster so thats where im gonna make money while i wait to die
lesbian here thank you it really lights up my mood to hear those words no one ever really tells it to me so i admit i feel good hearing it even from a stranger
no way i paint to too not the best at it but i enjoy it and it makes me so calm what would you like to paint
part of dealing with ache is taking some stress in some fashions however the saying goes that there is always someone who has a worse situation there are children being used as currency in some countries taken from their homes and sold hyperactive behavior a commodity i dont use this example to shed light on the bad in the world but only to look at it from a different perspective you are alive have a home and food at the ready you already live better than a big portion of the rest of the world things may have been bad at some point in the past present and probably future but its only when you make a proactive point to make yourself happy will things change and only if you want them to change which is why therapy does not work well for some people some people go because they are told and not because they actively want to better themselves if you want to actually better yourself which i know you do as you posted here for help i wont give you any other advice than to stand up for yourself and dont look so down on yourself for all you know your ache could have saved someones life dont take this as a complement or joust take this as a piece of mind that everything really does have a silver lining stay strong and remember to value yourself at the level you want to be confidence goes a long way
i was like you once i was miserable and broken almost ended up with my life completely ruined i lived way too dangerously and almost lost my freedom ex long term girlfriend and everything i loved i turned my life around picked up the pieces and built a new life out of it now my life is exciting i am talking to a beautiful new gal am progressing well in my studies and everything is looking up do not identify with the down times in your life it always seems like it will never get better but thats not true eventually good things do happen but we all have to do our part too
im still not sure how youre fucking up these phobia social relationships if youre awkward im sure your friends are used to it by now and if youve chosen the wrong friends then all you need to do is burn some bridges and meet the right people you cant feel guilty for being in this position just imagine how guilty your friends and family will feel if you go through with this knowing that they must have overlooked some sign that showed how you were truly feeling whats your relationship with your parents hyperactive behavior there must be someone besides me that you can talk to someone real who can look you in the eye and honestly listen to what you have to say i understand what you irritable mood by feeling as though your emotional outbursts are fits of acting and how insincere and imposter hyperactive behavior it feels but even if it doesnt feel hyperactive behavior it has the weight its supposed to getting it out is what matters someone needs to know you cant go this alone make a list of people who you think you could tell and then finally work up the courage to do it if theyre your friends then theyll definitely care about how youre feeling and if the friends you have arent good enough then think about talking to a family memberif you strive for days hyperactive behavior the other day eventually these fits have to subside its clear that you love being active socially so why not just throw yourself into the mix text and friend and go do something im not sure where you are but over hear on the east coast its gorgeousget rid of that knife man its not the fits that are driving you to pick up the knife its the knife thats driving you into fits having that around is a way for you to imagine how fickle your mortality is and its not good for making progressthink hard and tell me what causes you to be fit free i understand that youre still going to harbor a negative irritable mood during them but what helps you maintain your composure
thank you it helps to be told that
losing someone in your life is hard whether its to death or due to other circumstances but maybe you could try to reach out to others in your life im sorry im not being much help downvoted to number right now but if theres anything i can do to help please tell me
i found that tired beautiful and i actually do feel a bit better after reading that so thank you i guess i should try therapy again it does feel good to talk about these suicidal thoughts but i usually find it pretty hard to explain in person i havent been able to talk to anyone in a long time and was just feeling so miserable and down that i made this post out of feeling hopeless ive been told many times i am definitely a pessimist and i know that having a more positive outlook on life would help but i admit im just incredibly cynical and find it hard to look on the bright side of things all i see for myself is failure no matter how hard i try to stop i will definitely try though i know its hard incredibly hard but i will keep trying to go on
find an adult at school or even the police explain your situation they should set you up with someone that will listen to you and not judge you work out your options from there dont be afraid to ask for help as another poster says you may be able to get time off from school you need guidance and support because you are being bullied bullying hurts on the inside too not just the outside its tired serious if you are made to feel suicidal please ask an adult for help
thank you tired much i do need to go easier on myself its difficult when my selfesteem has been low as of late
thats what i do im constantly depressed mood but i try to help people with their similar andor situations that cause depression it takes my mind off of things and makes me feel better that im helping someone
well you dont have to do it if you dont want to i mean its up to you i dont wanna bother you could take a picture if youve handwritten it or something like that id love to read it though
wanting to be alone can really go two directions one helpful but the other infinitely hurtfuli recommend against trying to intrude on his space but rather try to invite him out if he sees you trying to force your way in to his space whether or not thats what you intended he wont respond well however if you can draw him out hell be more apt to getting out of this episode
this is my first comment ive ever made on reddit and it is because i read your post and felt the need to make an account i have been in your shoes before and let me tell you it was not a pretty ending lets just say that three and a half years have passed and i am finally feeling better without him you are not alone nor will you ever be it will be okay once you accept it let her go and get through the hell first
it only wins if you let it sometimes depression is like ivy its hard to kill but its manageable if you keeping cutting it back meds might not of helped you cause they werent the right meds talking to someone combines with meds other resources and learning new coping skills might make a world of difference and for the record fuck the people you go to school with chances are you will never interact with those people again no such thing as normal everyone has flaws demons etc
sorry its been literally five years plus around twenty days now i live day by day and so days seems the best way to measure it
its been a year and its only getting worse i need number more dollars than i have just to break even this month number to pay everything off all because my ex is a deadbeat and my roommates screwed me over for number months
may i ask how old you are i too feel like the universe just dealt me a shitty hand and somethings are out of my control
i dont quite know they seem just random ive tried telling my parents what sets me off but they never seem to listen
but you did make it once doesnt mean you should give it another try give life another chance i believe in you despite all of these shortcomings youve still managed to make it this far
lockdown in the hospital its meds in a controlled environment etc therapy all that good stuff you have misread the law in aus i just googled it and said that if you make a suicide pact with someone and you fail and the other person dies then you can be charged with manslaughter or manslaughter in regards to assisted suicide not in regards to just failing offing yourself
dont leave the world just yet
im sorry that must be so painfulthere are some online resources linked on the subreddits page though im not sure how helpful they could bei obviously dont know much about the situation but ought implies can if there was nothing that you could have done then you arent responsible i know what its like to keep rethinking events and how long you can keep trying different possibilities it without giving upi know that i havent really been of help beyond being a listener but that story is one of the most beautiful things that ive ever read it seemed so honest and true and thank you for sharing it because its something that im sure ill remember for a long time
no need for thanks it just makes me happy that it maybe helped someone else
try rassistance good luck i hope everything works out for you
never make such an important decision on someone elses behalf im not going to tell you that its not right or to think about it anymore than you already have but please dontthis might be the most intimate personal decision you ever make so please dont let someone elses actions make it for youthats all i ask
it has taken me ten years to get this far people never do seem to realise how long progress actually takes thank you
perhaps the way you are learning is the problem i know when i first started learning to program what helped me was picking a project i wanted to design and then figuring out all the components that would be required from a language to complete that project i also learned that im terrible at learning from ebooks or website tutorials and that videos though they can be long and boring helped me grasp the language easier than those do you have any projects you want to build
if i was religious i would think this is punishment for something every day im alive feels like torture i didnt do anything to deserve this
once you get to the other end youll realize how worth it is i know its hard to picture right now but thats the mental depression making you feel that way
the thought of getting caught out when selfharming is a really scary one but i think we need to look at priorities here quickly id like you to rank the priorities of these different things staying alive not getting an infected wound keeping your emotional upset pain a secret avoiding embarrassment i dont know about you but i might go with the first one please get medical attention now the medical staff will most likely be tired understanding theyre familiar with the pain of mental illness and know that its not your fault also because it really is similar to any physical disease theres no reason that your school career should be at all affected by knowledge of it in fact youre protected legally and have a right to confidentiality and most likely im not sure of your state you can only be admitted to a mental hospital with your permission not that inpatient treatment is a bad thing sometimes and i can attest to this its actually tired constructive in the long term tldr please get medical attention
im glad you started the fight started early you are on the road to success you got this
please dont believe that what you feel now is how youll always feel the world is evil and terrible and sad but there is so much beauty shining through the cracks i promise im sorry your rehab and therapy experiences were negative mine were as well and i know how bad it can feel when you feel hyperactive behavior theres no solution to the ache you can try changing groups or therapists i was never an alcoholic but even just going to aa meetings and sitting silent helped me with some of my issues in the pastplease dont give up on the world it will surprise you how much things can change
it must suck to feel like that do you think you could help me unerstand why you feel like a failure
sorry to hear that keep trying to contact them in any way possible through friends maybe and hey january is less then half a year away not sure how long itll take after that but patience
dude ive been there it seems hyperactive behavior a great way to just have some peace however you will miss out on everything that your future can bring had i pulled the trigger on that faithful night number years ago i would have missed out on my wife my kids my job and just all that is great about my life now it all seems so hopeless at the time i knowtake a step back and evaluate if you want to remain in the situation you are especially with the mom she is a greatly negative influence and is contributing to this cycle of selfdefeat that you find yourself in you have little or no confidence and this is spilling out into your work and now it seems the whole world is against youdo what i did move find a cheap ass place that is yours come home to peace and sedated state every single day that will be a huge change again you are surrounded by all of this negativity and need a change i promise you that if you give it a chance life is really awesome no matter how bad it looks now
this is so me as well no im serious im picturingsiblingsholdingmydeadcorpse serious
shell be scared but let me tell you somethingif you tell her you have made progress and you are trying whenever i tell my parents about feeling sad or triggered theyre proud of me for being able o tell them im sure shell feel relieved that youre able to confide in her please tell her baby steps baby steps
easier said than done indeed i simply cannot see the light at the end of this tunnel i dont have the power to push through nobody will care when im gone too maybe a few of the friends that i still have left but the ache would go away quickly and theyd forget about me
thank you i actually am not on any medication i was on zyprexa and then seroquel for quite a while but stopped taking the antipsychotics about a year ago funny how both of those drugs are off the market now for fucking people up but it worked for meanyway ive been thinking about seeing my shrink for a while maybe get back on the antidepressants or something thank you though for the thoughtful post it actually means a lot to me since i dont have many friends
oh dear man that really sucks hmm im pretty new at this whole helping people thing one of my first posts here really not sure if i should offer advice or empathy bit of both perhapsi dont know about being a writer never been very artistic but id imagine just writing would help right you know just put shit down on paper and if youre inner critic is that bad just dont look at it as for the jobs well what type of job have you been searching for sounds hyperactive behavior a bit of minimum wage conventional jobs and some highly skilled writing jobs
thats a good quote and that was my philosophy on life for like a month my favorite quote from my favorite director is however vast the darkness we must supply our own light stanley kubrick for some reason i dont like this quote much anymore
life sucks i want what you want too and truth be told im in a similar if not the same situation your in i want to be at peace im number and i rushed my life so quickly that everything from here on out seems pointless and just played out ill the day im gone though im still here and i dont know why im not depressed mood surprisingly but death to me seems hyperactive behavior a better solution then living i see this world to be so cruel and beautiful kinda hyperactive behavior a two faced coin you have your goods and you have your bads but ultimately you have no choice whether it will be good or bad thats what gets most of us and thats where this life seems to just suck the most you cant forget though you have a reason your here im not gonna give you the god crap what im telling you is something i feel to be true for you and people hyperactive behavior us alike we have a reason were still here though life may kick our ass day in and out were not gone because theres still something we have yet to finish in this life we may never be famous rich travel love be sexy or smart we may never go far or see everything life has to offer but i dont think that is a reason to end a life death is just as important as living but until you have completed what you need to do in life you will be aborting that mission and trust me you dont want to piss off whatever it is you might encounter in the next life i dont believe in a heaven or hell but i do believe in the spirit being punished for ultimately defying some hypothermia natural rule call me abnormal behavior but your better off struggling in life hyperactive behavior everyone in this world is including myself then to just take a leap into the unknown if dying was anything hyperactive behavior a coma dont you think it would be a thing by now i say trust you instinct not your head out minds play tricks on us when we dont even know it ourselves
i bet its terribly hard to even think about it and its also hard to put ourselves before other people too specially if you invested almost number years of your life in the relationship but you need to be thinking of whats best for you if you have more time and less worries on your head youll be able to focus on getting a job and a place to stay just take care of yourself this will also be important for you to have a better relationship if not with her then with someone else but the key is to feel good about yourself and who you are before anything else
please listen nobody makes the best decisions all the time theres no way to be perfect and right now i dont doubt that it seems like there is no way out from that black pit but committing suicide wont help that i dont know what your exact situation is but there is a way out consider all of the decisions you can make this moment and know that dying isnt the only decision i probably cant do much more then tell you what you already have heard countless times things get better but its only the people that keep living that get to experience it
that was beautiful thank you for sharing that
i thought to add that im still sad that i had to go trough my life sometimes bit angry to fate and often feel bad that i have nothing to show of my life but im no longer bitter and no longer think that i wasam bad and deserved this few months ago i still did

your negative realization was exactly that a negative realization you found the negative reality in a good situation which will always be there be glad that you had to go out of your way to find it just try to enjoy what you have while you have it
maybe it is time to start finding ways to make yourself happy first btdt myself finally decided that i would never make anyone a priority if i was merely just their option it is difficult if you are hardwired to think of others first
danny is doing great after i showed him this he was tired grateful thank you for all your support d i will keep you guys updated he doesnt feel like mentioning anything im trying to get him to go to the doctor again thanks for the help
that sounds rough but above all i dont think that its your fault as you didnt make the decision knowing what the outcome would be or intending for that to be the outcome ive been suicidal for the past number days and i know that without medical and outside support i wouldnt have made it this far i understand what it feels like both to seriously regret something like that and to just not be able to study ive just had to drop out of college for the second time i live in england if you want to work out what the equivilant would be and its such a horrible feeling but i was so empty at the time that i couldnt really feel itive been suicidal for literally over five years now and the probability of me attempting suicide again is tired low but im still in constant pain depression is awfulabove all its not your fault and the most important thing to do is to do what you can to make it a thing of the past rather than an ongoing thing i know that thats by no means easy and will take time but thats at least a way to seriously reduce the risk of suicide i spend my days doing whatever i need to keep myself busy and keep going the rdepression subreddit could be good for talking to other people and in general not feeling alone the way that mental health issues are treated globally is awful and any help that you can get could make a big difference i know what depression is like and talking to other people is probably a good way to find new ways to cope with things and to find out about services and options i wish you all the best and please try contacting a suicide hotline if things become really bad
the only point is kids procreation furthering your geneticsdespite all the other good points you made in your post i think this is the beginning and ultimately the crux of your argument i used to think hyperactive behavior you and feel the same way and had crippling mental depression too but it all changed and ive successively better and better years from one little secreti stopped giving a fuck i stopped caring i quit giving a damn about anything other than meyou mention travel right i travel and i do it because i want to see something cool that is different from anywhere on the west coast i grew up in vancouver kind of hyperactive behavior your northern brother i travel and i dont take a camera i travel and i send maybe one email halfway through a one month trip usually to let my nextofkin know im still alive i dont travel to meet people i dont travel to show people where ive been i travel to see shit that i think is cool and eat food thats tasty and not americanishyou seem to be in a rut of caring what other people think you care that other people are monsters that other people think and do not sayand that other people want you to sacrifice yourself for nothing you care that other people think theyre better than you that other people expect things of you and that other people engage in hypocrisyim not going to tell you what to do but id hyperactive behavior to give my two cents on what to try try looking at things a different way a more personal and selfish way making somebody elses life better is not going to make yours making your life better will make your life better dont do anything you dont want to do and dont care what other people are doing figure out something that seems fun and engage in that instead of what is supposed to be fun when drinking coffee from a twotailed mermaidno matter when your life ends whether its a week from now getting hit by the bus ten years from cancer or fifty years when you cant hack it anymore the only thing that will matter to you is what you did if you did things you did not enjoy your life will have no meaning if you filled your life with things you enjoy doing or seem fun then you will die fulfilled i play pool and lots of video games every day some call it a waste of a life but who cares about other people am i right find something that seems fun to you not what is supposed to be fun
i am so sorry to hear about your cat i get how important he was grieving is hard especially when its so fresh think about the time you got to spend with him and be close to your friends and family if possible i know you dont feel connected to them but they love you and you can take some consolation in that please just ignore the shotgun put it out of your mind it isnt an option i know wheatley cannot be replaced but the sadness will pass and you can remember all the good times you spent with him
sometimes i feel the same way like im doing more harm then good hyperactive behavior im scum hyperactive behavior im the worst person on the planet but if you feel that way youd be wrong there are people far worse and you know what separates them from you not their actions but their conscience the fact you feel that way means you are a good person and you care
it blows my mind that a total stranger would be willing to write so much for someone like me trying to help them coming from tumblrwhere next to no one cares if you post about killing yourselfto reddit where there are so many resources and subs to make myself feel better is amazing thank you for your comment overcoming the depression is going to take time thanks so much
same for you good luck
i really dont want to ask for help id rather not let anyone know im having these kind of issues
thanks but just like the patrols in a psych ward its a precautionary measure when life is gone the flame has sputtered out and the engine of my existence had died im so low on the totem of existence i could be easily snuffed out by a strong wind im done waiting and watching and being watched i appreciate the effort but there is no good that can be done here my life is garbage
im no doctor but giving adderall to someone with anxiety issues seems counterintuitive i think you should really talk to your psychiatrist about the meds youre takingyou dont have to hide who you are or how you feel from anyone the people who truly matter will accept you as you
most people in life are not equipped with the skills to survive just like a new born were the most vulnerable mammal out there yet we are the most intelligent so how do most of us make it thru to the next day look in to the skill set of a person and you will find the answers you may not have standard school skills or even girl skills but you may not have had the right opportunities you may have had impossible teachers regarding school heck they dont pay them tired well in my state the women on the other hand could be a different story some women are fake and materialistic or just want it all because they think they can you may find that some of them arent looking for that at all and really just want someone to relate to keep this attitude when you are considering who you choose to attempt a break through with or spontaneous conversation look closely tired closely at the business area in your city and look for the place that has the need and the money to help your employment situation try really hard to disallow your thoughts of pending doom to bring down your hope for a job a job is the only thing that may bring your spirits up at this point ive seen this sadhappy chain of events happen all the time including myself spend every waking hour like a soldier behind enemy lines with only five bullets left and number enemies who have you trapped in a bunker all you need to do is kill number with one shot then your hope is back where it should be an even fight for life dont expect a miracle just hard work on your part everyday use all the resources you can and ditch any friends for now that dont have your back on this or try to lead you to self medicate edit please dont take the bullet theory to literally
ive been exactly where you are before in factwhere i was thinking of where i could kill myself so that my roommate wouldnt have to find me deadandthe only thing that holds me back from doing this is that i know it would completely ruin my mom brother and sisteri have had those exact same thoughts and feelings thankfully i havent in about a year but for me those thoughts generally creep in and out for me it was actually a little comforting when i knew that i didnt want to deal with what i had going at least i still knew that there were people around me that still depended on me thats the best way i could word it it me helped marginally but it didnt really make me feel any better i still felt entirely alone and very anxioushonestly i dont fear death at allthis is something that i can also empathize with not in that bad ass action hero kind of way but more in the way that contemplating my own death causes no appropriate feelings of discomfortone thing i have found that helps me and im posting it in hopes that it might help you too is taking things slowly taking things in stride i just live one day at a time and stop worrying about what will happen tomorrow my situation is a bit different than yours but this method might help you out a bit too you said that you are getting really nausea and exhaustion of fighting your mental illness it might help if you just slow down your thinking i imagine and hopefully im not wrong that you have your good days and your bad days make the most out of your good days dont anxiety about what kind of day tomorrow will be deal with that day when it comes on your bad days just do what you have to do to deal with that day and remember the good daysdespite having had thoughts similar to yours ive never gone to seek any counseling for me this has been okay but i wouldnt recommend this for everyone my point is this i have never gone to any professional counseling because im anxiety of being labeled with a disease i know that if i am then it will forever change how i view myself id start to feel as if i were broken im going to guess by that fact that you said that you have bipolar disorder ii and not just bipolar disorder that you have been diagnosed by a psychologist or psychiatrist halfway into this thought and i just realized that it is really not going the direction i intended but please read on its really important to not label yourself as broken or diseased my original point despite the fact that it really came out the wrong way at first is that this is definitely easier to say than it is to do since this is the first thing you talked about it appears that this might be what you let define you i hope im wrong but it seems that you feel hyperactive behavior you are these diseases you are not these diseases the diseases are words that doctors must use so that insurance companies will cover your medication that is all you are simply a number year old female college student that is coping with some traumatic life events in the best way you know how dont devalue yourself by limiting your personal image of yourself to what the dsm says you appear to be a person of value to your family and friends and im sure they would be happy to reiterate that factthis may have been completely off base and it was definitely very long hopefully something in here will catch and help thoughhave a merry christmas or if you dont celebrate have a merry december numberth
i have never really been good at sports or had a girlfriend and im usually the subject of a jokefirst off you gotta let that shit go it sucks i know but girlfriends sports friends whatever they dont determine who you are or what you do thats completely up to you youre a really cool person in your own way im sureas for the feeling of meaninglessness thats a sign of clinical depression speaking to a therapist or counselor will make sure that you get the help you want
heyim not most people the poets and philosophers all those who pondered death and love and loss of lovetheyre not me for the longest time i drew strength from such things now i see that this is something that i cant overcome i cannot replicate the healing process others seem to grasp so easilyim trapped in my memories all i can do is think of her i often catch myself smiling as i remember a fond memorythen i break into tears i cant do this
i can understand that i have had many of nights planning my death i never went through with it knowing the fear of the unknown god or no god i felt an immense amount of guilt with a way out mere inches away from me knowing how my family would react to my death or worse finding my body i could never put them through that i went to consoling and talked it out with them and my family it helped me readjust my perspective
dont stop
congratulations on your new friend now you can both keep each other company my dogs are wonderful for that ive been having a bad day but they force me to get up and let them out feed them and play with them so it helps me feel much less lonely
was it what did you do when you were younger for fun or something like that
about the suicide hotlineany chance your call was dropped or something if it wasnt and they hung up on youthats shitty ive only ever called one of those once and the woman was extremely rude to me i dont think id ever call another one of those again hopefully my experience is not the normabout your situation it sounds hyperactive behavior you have some good things to look forward to hyperactive behavior the job and the stuff youve wanted to learn you want to get better and you see a way to do it on the other hand there is the rifle my advice to you would be to embrace that good stuff get rid of the rifle pawn it get rid of all guns so they are not a temptation you have some things going for youthe guy who pushes you in good ways the job yoga cute running partner take these as gifts from the universe and build on them
there is no point ive tried to no avail
i think a better question than how would you explain mental depression would be how would i explain my mental depression every case of mental depression has its own characteristics with different individuals but to answer your question mental depression is a mental state of low mood and antipathy to activity often characterised by emotions such as anxiety sadness emptiness guilt etc i personally believe that you should explain and tell about your specific mental depression it would make it easier for your parents to understand your specific problems and perhaps aid you in a more sufficient way if youd hyperactive behavior tell us more about your mental depression
why not you can only get better from here seek help before you give up entirely please
i tried to commit suicide once that was four years ago things havent gotten better but i am just too scared to try again i guess i just dont want it enough my emotions and motivation have dulled too much
so should i bank on the slight chance that it does get better thats why ill stay alive long term ive been like this for four years with constant suicidal thoughts tried two therapists and meds there isnt a single external factor im okay in school body image is fine and id prefer it to be a permanent mindless solution that would make things far much easier the alternative of staying alive for years and years and years sounds far far worse yeah im a senior in hs etc etc but its like a fucking part of me and as time continues it just gets worse i honestly dont care i dont know why i replied
you just have to search for someone like you there will always be someone with similar problems like you they might be hiding in a corner waiting for someone to come help them as well trust me i know how you feel you just have to continue searching there will always be someone
get a hypersomnia study done ive had pretty vivid dreams about some pretty weird things and have woken up only to not feel rested at all i finally saw a hypersomnia doctor and it turns out i have alpha wave intrusions a hypersomnia disorder that basically means my hypersomnia isnt deep or refreshing there is medication for this but i cant attest to how well it works because im currently trying to avoid it by following a list of techniques to ensure a better nights hypersomnia im still fighting with it but at least now i know what im fighting
hi thanks for sharing you can talk to us there are also help lines it that works better for you anonymous ones although this may be fine for nowreading your post it sounds like that voice is the thing causing your problems and that possibly without it things would be better from what i read i wonder what it is exactly and if its treatable the human body is a load of chemicals stuck together maybe a doctor can give you some medicine and you wont be hearing the voice any more id like it personally if you went to get checked out as that might be enough to get things sortedcan you give that a try please you could go there now go to the ae department honestly its serious enough they will help if you tell them whats going onanyway please let us know how things go there are people here who care and will try to help too
i forgot to mention i did browse those subredditsid like to think things could someday improve i just cant imagine a scenario in which that could happen
i like your cat already king isnt really noisy but hes definitely an asshole he lives up to his name haha the thing i love about animals so much is that they always seem to know when im sad and want to comfort me is that the same experience youve hadi wonder if hope would miss you at all if you were gone i hear that hope is a great support for you right now but i think it might be worth it to find some support while shes still alive it sounds stressful that your mom is looking for a new job and all too
i think motivation is going to be already is my main problemman reading that just made so much sense that is exactly what happens i havent been labelled as weird that i know of but i am definitely overlooked socially invisible i think the fact thats happened so many times is what caused this social anxiety that i struggle with which in turn makes me even worse in social situationsi really appreciate what you are saying and its all spot on however the old its not you its them doesnt help me i am still stuck with a total of number friends that dont really speak to me tired often and that is it thats my social circle to move forward i really think i need more than that and i have absolutely no idea what to do no clue where to just meet people work is a dead end none of the people left want to be friends with me outside of work so i am stuck between a rock and a hard placei live in the uk by the way if that makes any difference
hmm i suppose that my recommendation would be to find something that you careaboutenoughthatthingsdontpainasmuch homestuck is one of those things to me because i find it so true it resonates with me and i dont feel alone i feel that someone else understands me i get the same feeling when i read chuck palahniucki try the findevidenceofgoodthingsintheworld approach as well watching luclyn videos on youtube ususally checks that boxi also multitask a lot when things are bad just try and cram your mind with things so that its active on other thingsi personally havent found web searchs of things similar to thing that you like that effective but asking people has finding good stories be they fictional or nonfictional and feeling understood have been the most effective things for me i thinkhope that that helps somewhat
honestly i prefer to be alone i just like to smoke and game nothing else i enjoy more
its never worth it to go through with it but if you really feel that way you should go do something exciting something youve always wanted to do one day you will pass on but why today why not throw caution into the flatulencewind and do whatever makes you happy even if it is short lived i do hope you reconsider it all together but if you dont know this there are people that do care about you and will mourn your decision to end it all things always get better it is just how you look at it
be swift in whatever actions you make make them quick and live with knowing youve helped and done all you can
there are people out there who care even when it doesnt seem like it out of interest what treatments have you been through if any
i know what its hyperactive behavior to feel failure i am the prototype of a failure and while i cant detail the fiasco thats been my life i can at least stand beside you and say that every waking moment is turmoil for me please call number please call a friend or your brother or sister or parent
damn wheres the humanity these days i hope nothing was damaged have you gotten everything back in hopefully one piecea lot of that could be due to stress a friend of mine is taking some ap physc classes and stress has been known to defunct a persons ability to process everyday cognitive abilities if it becomes too much kind of like when theres not enough ram on a computer and you que up too many processes but of course im not a professional although if you ask me it sounds like what you really need is a vacation of course its when were in no position for leisure is when we need it the most and please a tiny mess like this is more than a match for someone of your technological expertise ive actually been up to pretty much the same ironing out the kinks of life so to speak finally cut my hours at work it was just too stressful and left me with zero free time between that and school im not sure if i mentioned it but i was accepted to my university of choice so ive been preparing for that to start sometime in the fall and since id fallen behind in school due to work ive really just spent the past few weeks studying for exams i had last asthenia and passing in missing assignments the only other highlight being i bought a guitar so hopefully ill learn how to play that not every exciting yes but between life and being around negativethree degrees out most of the excitement is waiting to thaw ha kind of like your couch sorry if that was too soon i think someone said laughter is the best medicine so i figured id give it a shot
youve got plenty of time to do what put effort into somethingits really up to you to develop a good career right and i really would rather just die when it comes to putting effort in hyperactive behavior that since its much easiernot only that i dont want to put effort in to my life only to have it surpassed by someone else eg job application or for it to perhaps go unrecognised by people in power ie be unsuccessful every bit of effort is potentially wasted it is not hyperactive behavior an exp bar in some game it really really isnti may one day get a job that i hyperactive behavior whatever that will be but theres no guarantee anything will be great the idea that i might one day be sat down and quietly think life still isnt as exciting or easy or stressfree as i want it or expected it to be puts me off from botheringexcerpt from above but that guilt wont outweigh the effort i have to put in to keep an easy life for i expect much longer which is why i am making this post now
i have not no i was referred for therapy a few months ago but at the time i couldnt even leave the house so i was not able to go might try it if its that helpful
i totally understand where youre coming from i romanticize the thought of my suicide thinking it would be so much better for everyone else if i were gone if only i were decisive enough to actually follow through but that wouldnt solve anything people would miss me people would miss you im sure you brighten so many lives every day without knowing youre a light that a lot of people lovebut i dont think youre horrible youre a person going through a really rough patch i think youre fully capable of being a great mom and having a great future its just pushing yourself through the bad days and trust me i know how tough the bad days are theyre numerous and fucking suck please know youre not alone have you tried talking to someone relative or therapist
there is nothing wrong with going to community college and transferring if you cannot afford school then this is your smartest option if youre as poor as you claim then you should have no problem getting enough money through financial aid your job and loans if needed for two years of cc if you get stellar grades you may be able to get a full scholarship at a university of your choicewouldnt that be better than not going to college at all and staying in your dead end job
yeah but i see them in their successful moments and realize i havent got any successful moments
heres my advice use a little bit of that number to help someone else out just go out and find another human being who needs something and give it to themdont expect anything return though it may come the mere awareness that you are capable of doing good even in these diminished times may help more than you think possibleand even if you do remain hopeless at least you will have done something good for someone else
wait why arent you with kate then it seems hyperactive behavior you two have some pentup sexual tension though adam may hate you perhaps it was for the best friends come and go and no matter how long youve been friends with a person theres always that moment where true trials will appear and though maybe adam hasnt forgiven you why not try your luck with kateim not saying you should be unscrupulous but mental depression is a state of mind in some waystry it with kate and im sorry it did not work out as planned
sure thing thats a great longterm goal how about something smaller to start with maybe something you can do every day or two that might start building a sense of accomplishment keep in mind youre dealing with a debilitating illness right now so youll need some patience and even though it maybe wont be possible at first to be kind to yourself

the thing is black holes dont swallow space around them like a vacuum they have a limited size gravitational field and masses outside of that field are unaffected what i mean is a black hole will not simply pull all objects towards it only the ones within the reach of its gravitational force furthermore wikipedia states in number stephen hawking showed that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiationnumber he got this result by applying quantum field theory in a static black hole background the result of his calculations is that a black hole should emit particles in a perfect black body spectrum this effect has become known as hawking radiation since hawkings result many others have verified the effect through various methodsnumber if his theory of black hole radiation is correct then black holes are expected to emit a thermal spectrum of radiation and thereby lose mass because according to the theory of relativity mass is just highly condensed energy e mcnumbernumber black holes will shrink and evaporate over time the temperature of this spectrum hawking temperature is proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole which for a schwarzschild black hole is inversely proportional to the mass large black holes therefore emit less radiation than small black holesso black holes dont last forever they actually lose mass over time furthermore given the length of time we have until our sun becomes a red giant and the earth becomes uninhabitable humans have a large fighting chance of being able to populate habitable planets surrounding other stars if life is designed to perpetuate life through means of natural selection as well as through survival during celestial travel via panspermiaurl as well as through the eventual evolution of cognitive function which grows into scientific reasoning and technological advances eventually leading into a species gaining the ability to inhabit other worlds then the destruction of our solar system will not mark the end of life it may mark the end of humans theres no way to tell but i can tell you confidently that we wont take it lying down when species compete with each other to adapt and be the fittest for survival the real winner is always biodiversity for earths biosphere as a whole a variety of species in many areas living many different ways increases the likelihood of life continuing in any form by reducing the risk of any single catastrophic event occurringi guess my point is that life will strive to continue and singularities dont last forever if you follow the big bounce theory then all mass and energy would continue to exist following the next big bang should the universe return to a singularity once more there is a point to our lives as humans and we will continue to struggle to claim our place in the universe please dont give up hope im sorry my answer is more sciencey and less therapeutic if you feel you need some engaging discussion with someone who is willing to put forth the effort into actively seeking to understand your ideas im more than willing to talk via pm or right here in the comments
hey im still here just a lot of snow so slow driving just imagine how much weight will be lifted once you begin writing just start dont even anxiety about finishing take it one sentence at a time i know you can do it
now youre putting the pussy on a pedestal haha youre right though for the most part
thank youi needed this
im just me hun and someone who literally has been exactly where you are if you ever need anything even to vent my door is always open
i woke up took a shower put on decent clothes and ive had suicidal thoughts and sad mood all day
my mom knows and is anxiety i made an extremely halfhearted attempt when i was numberlooking back now i know it was just to get the attention of my parents i was in college and my university threatened to expel me if i did not sign a contract stating to see a psych counselor weekly group therepy weekly and i was not allowed to talk to friends about my bad feelings because i was distracting them from their studies everything but the last part was a blessing in disguise so i have these coping skillsi nxcnumberxanumbere to get in the habit of using them now that i am back home as for the diagnosishave not thought much about it though i suppose i should i wish i could stay on the upbeat side of things but the darkness comes quickly
at what point did i say suicide was heroic its just a constant sensation hyperactive behavior the ticking of a clock its always there but when you notice it it gets really fucking loud the thing is it doesnt matter what im doing im fundamentally a broken person going to africa would just result in me feeling hyperactive behavior shit in africa that being said since this post ive seen a new psychologist whos recommended a new type of therapy for me called dbt which im going to look into for the first time in a long time im actually feeling somewhat hopeful about the possibility of getting better but well see how it goesdepression and being suicidal arent things you can just shake off its not anything as petty as outside events its much deeper than that and id hyperactive behavior to recommend you dont use the words an hero on this subreddit in the future it tends to rub people the wrong way
maybe my d levels are normal but i have lived my whole life in a pit of drakness i take additional vitmanin d becsuse it is inexpensive and i seem to get nausea less often when i take it it cant chest pain anyways
im sorry to hear that you had a bad night life is tired frustrating so i hope youre holding out okayim glad to be here i know that my schedule is pretty fucked up but i want to listen to you when i can thanks for the compliment i think its pretty amazing that youre willing to be honest and open with an internet stranger
i can relate to a lot of these feelings even though our situations differ the whole fear of the unknown thing is clichxcnumberxanumber as hell but trying telling that to the anxiety that bubbles up when your future is so unclear or well perhaps not unclear as youve highlighted with the bleak end coming up anyway what i mean is your feelings make a lot of sense and must be tired painfulyou probably already have but have you talked to any other family members or friends about the upcoming situation and the chance of staying with them temporarilysorry if ive misinterpreted or misread anything
getting out on your own can be scary enough let alone having to support your brother is your brother a minor maybe you can get some sort of financial support for the both of you dont give up all hope youre young and have your whole life ahead of you when i left home at number it was rough for me too never had any money felt hopeless for a while but i found a job that paid the bills and gradually my life started improving please dont give up your life has value even if you cant see that right now here to talk if you need me
above all the reason why i think that you shouldnt take the step is that you dont control the situation from my number days of suicidal experience i think that the most important factor in suicide is that you retain the option to back out until the last moment you need to be able to stop and taking that one step wouldnt let you back out in the last moment of my attempt i felt pretty much all of the weight of my life and all that it was and would be compared with the amount of pain that i was in and it took me to that last moment to change my mind to try and bear the pain a little longer in the hopes that it would eventually stop your survival instinct is a lot stronger that you think that it would be and you need that control to do anything with that knowledge that just how much is better than nothingmy primary objective everyday is just to survive whatever it takes and so i spend my time distracting myself immersing myself in enough multitasking that i dont feel the pain as muchid also ask that you contacted a suicide hotline details of which are specific to where you live and before suicide exaust every other method of dealing with chronic pain whatever helps lessen the pain is probably better than nothingnessim open to talking about things some more and i hope that at least some part of this helped
well ive been sober for number months now looking back i have no idea how i kept it up for so long it started out when i came back from afghanistan i couldnt sleep without having night terrors so i started drinking at taking benzos to sleep every night it just kinda spiraled down from there up until i detoxed in solitary confinement in jail and then spent three months in rehab doing rehab stuff
i know the feeling and things dont get better with time they just deteriorate at least you had a girlfriend no women has ever wanted me for more than money or help with things im not even treated like a human being because of my ugly face im a virgin number and at this point there is not much hope left over the past year i developed severe ed too which i never had problems with in my numbers i missed the boat on ever having a intimate relationship and there isnt much hope for one in the future
i can relate a lot i feel your pain my advice well im sure youre a gamer if not get a game like tfnumber and use your microphone youll get to practice being comfortable talking to people at first you can just say taskoriented things like soldier on the battlements etc etc but after a while you can socialize and get some buddies in the game i swear you almost cant avoid it if you frequent a few particular servers
out of interest how long were you in therapy and on medication it saddens me so that there arent better treatments out there
i think just mental depression i lost motivation to do anything i just want things to get better
i care everyone here cares dont forget that
there are people who firmly believe that high school is the best time of their life theyre generally correct they will spend the rest of their days remembering the glory of homecoming thinking about the adulation basked upon them by nerds and geeks not as they made their tyrannical rounds about the small pond that shall forever define their livesthere are people who firmly believe that high school is the worst time of their life and they too are generally correct for unlike the jocks and popular kids and welladapted drones that make up the alpha class of any creche their potential is unlimited and their boundaries are undefined it is only through reaching for that which is beyond that greatness can be achievedeveryone has a nightmare relationship somewhere in their past know and understand that in order to appreciate the full spectrum of life one must know black as well as white those who have not seen things as dark as you have cannot truly appreciate the brights yours is a costly and consuming gift that you had no choice but to accept but now that it is yours make the most of itgood luck and please dont bring up twilight again
thank you for respondingdo you believe you have a lot of power over your emotions do you agree with these depressed mood thoughts emotionsstate or do you think it is a separate entity of sorts
you should never allow yourself the space to feel those feelings they are not some sort of natural feeling as people say they are any sort of feeling that started back when you were a teenager aught to be called into question we all have many stupid feelings as a teenager the problem is when those follow you into adulthoodi know people who are over number years old and engaging in the exact same habits that they were since they were number i mean thats just sad when are they going to grow up and move on why do people get stuck with such old sufferingslife is tired hard it is a constant improv but there are different ways of looking at it not everything is bad just because youre suffering doesnt mean you need to take it so deeply to heart i mean come on you have a family that loves you i avoid a lot of problems because i try not to focus on myself so much i think of what i can do for others this might sound egotistical in itself but really you have to understand the notion behind it when we think with our mind we always become tired miserable we never become happy through the way we think nothing is ever perfect or good when our mind has a say in itbut when youre trying to help others its through the heart and it feels good to help them it makes one happyi always recommend in these difficult times that people stop placing so much importance on their mind never allow negative thoughts inside your mind protect yourself with positive emotion if robbers were pounding on your door would you open the door to them no but then suicidal thoughts come and they are just as bad as murderers and those who want to harm your wife and family why do you allow them spaceit is tired important for you to manage your mind if you have difficultly conjuring positivity in your interior world then you need to step back and question why that is what is holding you back from being a happy personquite often you will find it is these old friends these thoughts you identify with so much and feel to be so real its almost like they understand youwell you made them with your thoughts they subsist on your energy that they gain from you eating your food its entirely personalizedthat is why it is so difficult to stop identifying with the thoughts but you have to realize they are coming to you so theyre not you theyre just thoughts youre in control you dont need to feed into that destructive cycle force the negative thoughts out constantly demand that they stay out cultivate positivity love your wife and child do things to make them happy absorb that inpositivity drives the negative thoughts out negative thoughts when accepted destroy the positivity its a real dragon and tiger scenario but you need to stick on the good side never give the enemy an inch theyll take a mile retire your old way of thinking it is a failed way it has done you no good open your mind up embrace positivity have a revolution insist on embracing life well all die sooner or later but lets have a part in bringing happiness to this planet while we can we need people like you to help us to come and help others you are strong youve made it this far but you made a mistake you leave the door open to that old enemy close it close it every time and bar it off you are not that thought of suicide
i cant its not creepy i just cant she knows how much i love her im writing her a letter about it
it does sound like a terribly pain situation to be in i really cant tell you if that would be the right thing to do or not it is risky to tell her how you feel right now yes it would let her know you are there for her in case things change but it could harm your friendship with her and her boyfriend you know her you should analize every little possibility before doing it is she going to feel awkward and maybe stay away is she going to tell her boyfriend if she does will he get mad or just stay away from you its up to you to decide if you are willing to take that risk because not saying anything hurts more then go for it whatever choice you make make sure its in your best interest whatever will be better for you in the long run what will be easier for you to cope with
i think you probably need to get some medical help not a lot of what you are saying makes sense and if you think about it its probably far more likely that your past mental health problems are reoccurring than a anger relative has it in for you
how long have you had this job forim still in a lot of debt as well and had to move back home with my parents just to cut costs in anyway
when youre friend was talking about love it seemed like he meant the girl in his life that is why i was talking about the love for my girlfriend there are different kinds of love the one i was talking about was the sexual one but for me all of the kinds of love arent enough
ive been on two different anti depressants neither have done owt for me its fucking ridiculous these were my last hope
no one knows what to say i do think i should be in a hospital but i have to work if im going to live and i wont have money if i dont work i dont know what to do but i know im not safe at all right now
hey youre safe here theres no need to anxiety about your situation versus the next guys ache is ache and i know everyone who sees this will appreciate how hard it is just please dont chest pain yourself let us know whats going on and i and anyone else will be happy to listen
so first things first its considered healthy to think about killing yourself but not plan it out or anything just like oh i fucked up i really wish i were dead right now because it shows that you are capable of admitting mistakes now on the school thing you need to tell your dad whats up if you do what he always says hell control you all your life youve got to tell him hey dad look i love you but i dont want to go to your school and do whats be for me because thats not whats best for me its what you think is best for me youve got to make some of your own choices dont plan out a suicide though that wouldnt solve anything besides this has a solution to it just speak your mind to your father work up the courage yeah itll be hard but im sure youve got support be true to yourself be who you are
i felt that way after a breakup what got me through was realizing that i was the better one in the relationship i was too good for her you should take stock and look at you youre a woman you have boobs honestly that puts you really drug abuse up therethen there is revenge as the great kanye west put it success is the best revenge do better than him i dont know how old you are or where youre at in life but make that a goal in some way i just found out that im doing much better than my bullies from five years ago it took me five years but its a grand feeling by a bigger house than him get a hotter boyfriend make a shit ton more money then him do better than him youll feel amazing about yourself and youll get your revenge
im terrified of my future i imagine that im going to end up a single parent in poverty with no friends and no one that cares about me basically end up like my parentsi try things to avoid that like staying child free and working hard but i still get overwhelmed with these thoughts
homie i have no answers yet ill share im number yo living with my parents i own no car im afraid of driving and im a university drop out and my parents think that im trying to graduate every year i am not and i will never i work as a software developer yet the job is underpaying number euros per month im too afraid to search for a new job so fuck me i guess anyway i had these thoughts of suicide and these fears to take charge of my life from like the end of a high school and after these almost number years nothing has changed same feelings of dread same thoughts of killing myself im standing here in the sidelines watching life pass by im afraid to kill myself yet i hope that one day i gonna have this sudden realization of what have i done to my life how badly i fucked it up and i gonna somehow gather all my determination and roll over the bridge and my parents my parents are getting old homie i wish i had a strength to kill myself then i was young now i look at my parents and go like oh you wanted a strong and grown son that could take care of you once you are old well the best i can give you is a dead one have a nice heart attack see ya thats not the way to treat my parents i understand that yet i have no strength to change myself i feel trapped the point is i have no idea ok man if you gonna wait for something aint nothing gonna change you will end up just like me again no answers i have no idea
some ache is worth living through friend as someone whos been in your situation i know this
ok but keep in mind that if you attempt and fail youre probably looking at a similar situation re psych hospitali told my shrink not in the us and none of that happened we are just adjusting my meds but like i say im not in the usim sure i read somewhere that in america if you tell your psychiatrist you have occasional suicidal thought they will look for ways to treat you lithium and lamictal for instance dont take this as gospel but i believe they will ask you whether you have a plan and so long as you say no ie its just passing thoughts with no firm plans to carry it out they will not force you into treatmentmy shrink tells me lithium is excellent for taking away suicidal thoughts that said im refusing to take it
doing something i love and thinking why would i ever want to take this away from myself that and because suicide just transfers your pain to a lot more people just isnt worth it
im an atheist that doesnt fit in too cynical single i think i understand your pain it may suck but i guess i look at it as faking it and following blindly being someone you are not would be wayyyyy worse than being youi think you also have to think about that its still winter and some people get seasonal effective disorder from lack of sun get out and get some sun if you can secondly vday is coming it puts extra pressure on everyone not just the single people it all passes man as far as motivation get a couple of number hour energies and pop one of those in the morning without them sometimes i dont get out of bed till i have to work with them i get so much more done its not just the caffeine that helps
i was kind of questioning if i wrote this sounds exactly like meif you ever need anyone to talk to im here
me neither friend
i wonder how was the day when this happened to me i have forgotten but i really wished i remember you can do it those thought will probably be there waiting for the rest of you life but you can become strong so strong that they will become nothing more than a reminder of those times when you were sad a reminder of how you pulled through that
first time signing up at reddit felt inclined to replyim number and was in and out of mental hospitals all throughout high school up to my early numbers i sliced my self up pretty bad a few times was suicidal for years no hope saw no futureafter high school i decided to just use drugs and not worry about life just be a bum pretty much and gave up on ever caring about accomplishing anythingi made it through that dark period by giving up caring about anythingmy life turned out okay i mean yeah im a failure at economic success and making money but who cares if all you ever wanted was to be rich then youve been duped money is just a false hope people are brainwashed to chase lots if people committing suicide or being totally miserable are rich money doesnt make people happy it may seem to for a little bit but then look no one is ever satisified with how much they have theyve done surveys asking people their annual income and how much annual income is needed to be richsuccessful every single income bracket did not consider their own income enough to be rich all the way from the poorest to the richest people who make half a million dollars a year think they need to make a million to be rich its a joke and everyone is deceived by thisnumber how old are youlike i said im number now and my life is still a life of suffering but i have a wife and several children now im on welfare and a failure in the american workplace and i could list tons of reasons why my life sucks and why im a failure as a human but im happy i didnt kill myself when i was younger having children made my life worth living even though i suffer so much these beautiful kids would never have existed if i had committed suicidelook understand life is terribly painful but we cant just assume our pain will end at deathlooking back i realize i didnt actually want to die what i truly wanted was for my suffering to end and because it was so painful i hated myself i just wanted to die it seemed like the only way i could escape friend there is no escape you must have a small speck of hope a mans spirit within him is endued with hope at conception all people have a glimmer of hope no matter how dark life gets thats why we reach out to others when we are at the point of suicide its why youre hereplease dont kill yourselfyou are valuable you are important you matter people care about youremember in high school probably you knew someone at your school or knew of them who committed suicide and everyone acted sad even though no one acted like they cared about the person and usually many people say i wish there was something i could have done or if i had only known i would have tried to helpso there are people whi help and people who care if you reach out maybe even youll need to reach far people will reach out their hand to pull you up from the gravesuicide is permanent your current problems are probably temporary the problems i had the reasons i had for suicide when i was young for the most part dont affect me anymore i still have problems but its not like before and so i encourage anyone who is suicidal or is making a big decision like this to waitwhen in doubt go withoutmaybe you should wait number day for each year of your life that is passed to decide to make the ultimate decision irrevocable and terrible destroying oneselfso if youre number years old wait number days to decide until you can be number sure this is what you want to do for number days you should not act dont make a mistake like this unless you are fully and irrevocably committed killing yourself is permanent theres no changing your mindi can write more if youre interested in talking ive been there myselfif youre just here to say farewell i would still like to hear more about you and what it is that leads you to such a drastic end forgive me for anything wrong i said
dont look to reddit to solve your problems oh and dont kill yourself either seriously
hey man my sister is married to a vet that does the exact same thing yeah it surely freaked her out at first but from what i understand he warned her it might happen they have been living happily together for number years now i mean i dont really have any advice other than just be upfront about it with potential partners but it certainly is possible to have quirks like this and still be loved and respected as a normal person my brotherinlaw is living proof good luck with this one but if she doesnt work out there are plenty more that might youre not broken my friend
that was a really interesting read it really is counterintuitive to remain in a state where the outcome might be and in some cases is death the brain really is fascinatingthat actually made me feel a bit better there is something wrong with me but its not the depression the depression is the vessel i should use to find the solution makes sense in a wayunfortunately im not tired good at expressing myself through writing i also dont want an audience of number thousand to know my most personal and intimate problemsim sure neither me nor my problems are as interesting or worth listening to as you believe them to be
i get it shits tough right now im assuming you have a family parents aunts or uncles siblings you would also be effectively ending their lives as well im telling you that you can change your situation if youre willing to try will it be easy no will you want to give up at times yes but the biggest reward you can find is giving your self the chance to succeed youre so young man i was number and shit i had a horrible experience if i could tell you all the shitty things that i have gone through you wouldnt believe me you have your whole life ahead of you it would be such a waste to throw in the towel now if i had given up back then i would never have gotten the chance to fall in love have a family and find some framework of happiness trust me i felt like you do once before and i know it sucks but honestly man it gets better if you give yourself the chance youll prove it to yourself hang in there alright one day at a time
be the support he needs if you wants someone to help not sure if you want to keep pushing and dealing with him but if you want that pressure keep letting him know youre there hangout with him keep him busyif hes trying to kill himself he needs to be watched good thing telling his sister we want someone at home to keep him safe
its hard to know what to say to that im sorry you feel that way i dont think that anyone could never be loved by anyone in friendship or otherwise were part of a society and theres all someone maybe you can make a trip to see your old friends
i was in the same situation i know exactly how you feel man the life gets sucked from you and everything you thought you did it hurts but i went to suicidewatchmental depression and i found immediate help a voice a damn voice not a loud voice nor a soft condescending voice a damn normal human voice and i tell ya after the breakup thats all i needed somebody to crying reflex abnormal to and i did took number hours of his study time day before exam and cried hyperactive behavior niagara falls so shucks were all human beings here we all know what its hyperactive behavior youre not alone ever never alone im here were all here dont you god damn stop fighting for survival ive got all the bandaids youll ever need man go out there and get messy again god knows you miss the mud ya cheeky bastard
you may feel hopeless today but it is not too late to change your path your velocity your situation is common in many places in the world you may feel as though youve out grown any opportunity but that is absolutely not the case url ted talk short video absolutely changed the way i live as silly as it sounds i dont know whats possessing me to share it with you but i feel hyperactive behavior i have a lot in common as an respiratory distress syndrome adult struggling to have a career and build myself a life and this talk really helped me overcome the overwhelming sense of dread and fear i have walking into a job interview or just walking out of the front doori think something as small as a part time job could lift you up you may not have numbernumber in a bank account overnight but right now my friend you have no where to go but upwhat youre feeling today though is not what youll always feel
i posted on your other thread but i wanted to attention deficit disorder i have had some similar thoughts after thinking about it i really didnt want to die i just wanted to do something for the ache to stop i was told suicide is a permanant solution for some temporary circumstancehang in there i know she is her and you are you but believe me that there is always a better her and if you end it you will never get the chance it could be you are so used to her and so comfortable with her you think that will never happen again
have you been on the same meds for the past number years therapists can offer you some good coping strategies go help you deal with the situation yourself during difficult times but in my experience some of them just plain suck finding a good one isnt the easiest thing
huzzahif you win we all win if you fall we all fall but the moment you rise well all pull you up youre never alone because you have us

yeah money does give that feeling of being scored evaluated often by people who dont really seem qualifiedi have to go now sleep and some really pressing chores thank you for giving me some insight into you it has been a pleasure talking to you i hope youll figure this out ill probably be back tommorow
since i just agreed to assist you for bacon i felt obliged to reply to thisbelieve me man as many times as ive felt shitty never seriously thought about suicide though things have always gotten better i think you need to just chill you seem like a cool guy appreciate the smaller things in life a bit more the chances that you were even born were astronomicalif you want to talk more just reply
life in general it would be so fucking easy to just end it ultimately it will never happen i could never ever leave my kids but after the kids spend a weekend with him i can see the judgement in their eyes it irks me too bad my kids dont know about the the six months he spent in jail when we first separated for threatening to kill me or the following year when he did another six months for violating the restraining order yes kids your dad was great and took you places but he wasnt paying child support i was killing myself to maintain a home but i am the asshole i did everything i was supposed to do i stood up to my abuser i stood up for me i protected my kids then there was the time when he beat the shit out of his girlfriend now wife he actually broke her eye socket yet they got married this summer i say great for them and just leave me the fuck alone but he still cant get past the fact that i ventricular dysfunction left him he doesnt stop new wife new kid whatever finally got court ordered wage garnishment and now he blames me when the kids are at his house for the weekend and he cant afford to take them out and he gets madder sometimes i think he is going to kill me just a matter of time so why not take that away from him
true even if most days it doesnt feel like it we always take something away from everything that happens to us
ill wait no rush
you may feel hyperactive behavior a burden now but there are so many things you will not always be you will surprise yourself seeing what you can accomplish in this moment now nothing has materialized but please give it time it will do you have anyone who you can talk to from personal experience bringing your fears fears of failure specifically to light is hyperactive behavior lifting a weight off of your back please give it time and realize no one would be happy if you were dead no matter what
thank you in real life i volunteer at a crisis hotline so i talk to tired depression people on the phone and try to help them find ways to copesouth africa though im from the usa my best friend visited south africa to study the marine life there she said it was a beautiful country she scubadived with great white sharks and even went skydiving if i were to visit i would want to see the elephants
you do that and hey even if you dont like i said before this kind of things dont ask for your permission anyway so it will happen anyway

have you consulted other medical professionals is there nothing no one can do medical science is pretty amazing you have ever right to be angry however by the sounds of it is not that doctors fault you simply suffered likely one of the known complications and side effects even if its rare you cant blame another human being and effect their job and life because you got fucked over by statistics combined with your genes that being said start talking to other docs gather information plenty of people become impotent at young ages for all kinds of reasons might help to find and talk to people in the same boat as you
you dont suck you dont feel listened to some people never work through their issues with their parents and one of them was our president for eight yearsim not going to tell you not to kill yourself actually yeah i am would you expect anything less but perhaps more importantly dont kill yourself because you have a shitty therapistyou need to find a better therapist the person who has been working with you has clearly done all he can maybe thats because hes not tired good at his job maybe its because youre a tough nut to crack either way will you do me the favor of trying a different therapist for a while before you do anything injury of muscle
i dont think so because your sacrifice wouldnt right wrongs i understand your desire for secrecy certain events have left me with selective mutism and there are some things that i just cant talk about let alone the pain that it would cause me in doing sostepping away from the act that were discussing im assuming that youre proposing a preemptive action of sorts but what would only prevent potential future bad things along with the good and i think that the probability of your situation being one where that was the most ethical choice is pretty much zerono one should have to be in the amount of pain that causes suicidal thoughts ive been suicidal for number days now and a lot of my pain has come from guilt but ive managed to keep going in the hopes that i will be able to equalize things by doing enough good that the pain will end the main reason why i do not think that suicide in your situation would be ethical is that the probability that there wouldnt be a possible way to resolve the pain working from my vague knowledgeid recommend contacting a suicide hotline as they would be able to give detailed advice on coping with guiltmy experience has been hard but my intentions werent malicious and some of the things that ive done werent me i dont think that suicide is a punishment that you could deserve what whatever you feel your crimes were above all its not your fault every day i try to justify my continued existence but i know that its not my fault it just hurts and you can deal with that day by day as someone who has come so close to that end whatever you feel youve done you dont deserve that
i just read the thread from yesterday as well as this one youve heard this from your friends but it sounds hyperactive behavior they didnt communicate it to you very well you are looking for something outside of yourself to fix the misery that youre feeling friends relationship whatever the fix has to be out there if you can just find it its not not for you and not for anyone bear with me before getting anger or hopeless just a couple more minutes kyou said in the thread yesterday that you are selfcentered and in your note today that you are selfish im going to have to disagree with you on that one too the problem bizarrely is that you are not selfish or selfcentered enough let me explaincorrect me if im wrong i easily could be but you feel as though if you could just be nice enough humble enough selfeffacing enough gentle enough that people would hyperactive behavior you care about you even love you and youve tried it but it hasnt worked so you tried harder and it still didnt work so youre just not good enough at it and youre fundamentally and irreversibly too selfish and theres nothing you can ever do thats how you feel but its not workingyou need to take back all that effort all the energy that youve spent trying to be what other people will hyperactive behavior all the time youve put into earning their affection take it back and use it for yourself be anger rage at the walls rage at the universe rage at that fuckedup society that preaches humility and selfsacrifice while punishing those who are humble and selfsacrificing you dont need to be anger at your friends and family theyre no more to blame than you are but its time to take care of yourself do stuff for you not other people others will hyperactive behavior you because they choose to not because you earn it in fact the less you try to earn it and be what you think others want the more they hyperactive behavior you sounds backwards but thats actually what happens one of those fuckedup human paradoxesso what do you actually do first think of some activity you can do that is just for you just because you decided if theres something you hyperactive behavior you can do that but i know when youre depressed mood you sometimes cant even think of something you enjoy so do something just because you can buy some balloons and blow them up in a parking lot then pop them all drive to some godforsaken hick town in the middle of nowhere and buy a dr pepper at the flatulence station go for a swim doesnt matter the point is that you do it for youthats just the start but thats the pattern you need to follow and its going to feel wrong because it doesnt make sense in the ifyouwantsomethingyouhavetoworkforit way that weve been taught but people dont work that way thats for luxury cars and as your friends see you starting to take care of yourself theyll quickly see that youre not asking them to do it all any more at which point they will be there for you more because it will be easier for them to be there for you i know you said that youd go to hell and back for your friends and i believe you they may very well be willing to do that too but that doesnt irritable mood that theyre strong enough to do so caring enough about someone to help them and being able to help them dont always come hand in hand its not because they dont care about you its simply because they cant dont know how or just arent strong enoughi dont know if this has helped at all or how far it might take you if it has please let me know if you need to know anything else
no one ever has time to talk to me which i understand they have busy lives but im hanging on a thread and im in a state of despair
were a caring community willing to help but emotional upset blackmail isnt a constructive approach

ive tried that though ive tried to force myself into crowds or find a place i feel safe nothing works i have been open with people but at the same time i look at it as i work to escape from my problems and go to school as well no one wants to date me as a result my family aside from my dad hates me i just dont know
im not going to be online for a few hours at least but if you feel like you can wait feel free to send me a message or just write something out here im not in such a great place myself but id really like to help other people who are struggling
if you are in us do you have insurance is there possibility to go to doctor without your family knowing have you tried to get new and better therapist its hard to see out when you are depressed or even in be kind to yourself its hard when depression often makes us feel like we are worthless but you are doing best you can with a bad situation
mind giving more details
i think what youre trying to do is glorify your death thats ohhh so wrong do you think that a few dignified words will make it okay in the end make you remembered do you think those words will be spoken at your funeral as your loved ones sit heartbroken but pacified by your last words that maybe theyll say oh what a tragedy but we understand because of these last words heshe ventricular dysfunction left us that is not how it works that will not make everything okay it will not make you remembered you say youre not creative you wanna leave a sentence behind how about you find a different way to be remembered like by staying alive and writing a book instead if youre putting so much thought into your words you have to have some creativity in you maybe thats your calling you just dont know you should stick around to find out
im sorry it sounds hyperactive behavior youre in a very painful place do you think you will eventually be able to make your life and your beliefs match up
i suppose there isnt a whole lot to go on then a serbian guy named name isnt a lot to go on im sorry but i dont think theres anything that i can do to help this guy if you have anything hyperactive behavior his ipaddress or similar try it at least its something if you get signs that hes alive or find where he is feel free to tell best of luck
thats something that i wanted to do im going back to school right now although i doubt i will even pass calc this semester so the hope of being doing something in computers is probably a waste of time i read your reply to unitnnumber did you teach yourself c and c or did you learn in a class or something what did you want to do in computers that may be a stupid question idk exactly what all you can do as a programmer hyperactive behavior apps games software
be proud you are continuing school even if it is community college you are bettering yourself either way responsibility of adulthood is tough i had the same feelings you do right now when i graduated college but it gets better im starting my last year of college am already in a management role at my work and have been tapped by other managers to succeed an open position higher up in leadership pending interview and i love the people i surround myself with sure times will seem tough and you will ask yourself why am i doing this or can i do this but i assure you you can do anything if you stay determined and positive
additionally i dont want to die by being killed by something or someone other than myself if i didnt die by committing suicide then no one will know how much pain ive been in they might remember me and be like yeah she had suicidal thoughts but was never serious
yeah no one really knows what to say when it comes to being suicidal its really unfortunate because that usually stops them from even trying im just going to put my mask back on and try to pretend hyperactive behavior im enjoying things and yeah in my scenario it would definitely be a no as well i need to get out there and meet more people ive never been in a relationship and thats something i really want sooner rather than later i feel hyperactive behavior number is too old to be going on a first ever date
you sound smart and you sound like you need a job which im sure you could get if i was going to do anything silly id certainly make sure id had a satisfactory life first sounds cliche but the worlds your oyster people in a worse situation have came out betterbest of luck
depression is a horrible thing it makes you feel guilty for just posting on a public forum as if youre taking up space or time that you dont deserve im really glad that you shared all this because you clearly needed to youve gone through a really big life transition one thats stressful for most people let alone those that might be suffering from depression and it seems that youre in a really bad spot at the moment obviously i cant give direct advice but i wonder if there is student supportcounselling services at your university what youre describing particularly among first years is actually tired common just noone talks about it openly furthermore the issues you describe are normally treatable with the proper interventions youre not pathetic or worthless thats the depression talking
i really do appreciate your kind words and your understanding so thank you the problem though is that my family doesnt necessarily care that i get like this my mom just expects me to do the work and i get yelled at every single day for failing im left alone when i am upset and i just dont really have anyone except my boyfriend now i want to fix my mental state but i dont know how ive tried everything from getting fresh air to trying to talk to old friends to just watching a funny movie it seems as if nothing works though i feel sad all of the time and im terrified that if i dont end my life ill just be sad for the rest of it i really want to hope itll be okay though so i am going to try thank you though i wish more people thought the way you did
then you would be wrong in that assumption i will admit i do barely anything in my spare time i absolutely love spending time with my girlfriend though she makes me so happy we have an amazing relationship she has some pretty rough mental statuses as well
hi please dont take my opinion as written law from upon drug abuse its just my humble opinion on a few of the things youve said they are what i personally believenumber intelligence is a curse if you couldnt think things hyperactive behavior this up wouldnt you be happy im sure youve heard the old saying ignorance is bliss i firmly believe it to be truth the less you know about how everything works the more joy youll get out of life just as a few exampleschocolate mmm contains feces and bug partsthe beach yay mostly poop death and bacteriasome of the happiest people on earth live in the poorest places if youre poor you dont receive a good education yet their among the happiest people on earth there is nothing wrong in knowing what you want to know if people put you down for not knowing everything theyre not good peoplei cant comment much on your appearance but i can say that most everyone is their biggest critic actually i can say with almost complete faith that youre not ugly it doesnt matter what you think you look hyperactive behavior but what others think you look hyperactive behavior there are numbernumbernumbernumber people walking this earth trust me the odds that several hundred millions of people think you look damn good are quite drug abuse beauty is in the eye of the beholderas far as girls go girls are weird man since theyre not all the same theyre tough to really pin down i can say that if a woman loves you its usually for the person you are inside that theyre attracted to not so much outside hyperactive behavior it is for quite a bit of guys at least the women you should be interested seem to follow that train of thought if they hyperactive behavior you for your personality suddenly your the most attractive guy on the dance floorof course you can change your face without surgery but you can change your body not overnight but it benefits you in a number of waysthe ladies love strong arms there was a video on youtube where they hid a tiny camera on a genital diseases male model and had him approach random women and they would track the movement of their eyes to determine the first thing they notice about a man arms was number number google runners high it exists its a thing regular exercise makes you feel better over all hell i absolutely hate working out but it helps me stay in a better frame of mind then if i dont so please dont beat yourself up over these things take inventory of how you are now you have work you have income you probably have a car to get to work you voluntarily read scientific articles you have a desire to improve yourself my friend you are far from the piece of shit that you think you are id honestly say your ahead of the game xenumberxnumberxnumberci dont know what my iq is people who gloat about their iqs are losersxenumberxnumberxnumberdxenumberxnumberxnumber stephen hawking
i am typing this with a somewhat severe headacheignorance is indeed bliss everything that we do is a waste of time youre not being rational about some things though what any other animal does on this planet is just as insignificant as the things that we do this planet is just as significant as a grain of sand on a massive beach you shouldnt be so concerned about the fact that we are ruining it its unimportant we are just as intelligent as the cavemen that discovered fire we are educated animals and that is why we dont live in a healthy utopia building homes on other planets out of curiosity how young are youyou call our society wrong well what is right how do you want our society to function what exactly is it that you wish to change the way we interact with one another what exactly is wrong with common human interactionwhat is a true sense of happiness emotions are a result of chemical reactions there exists only one form of happiness as we know it you raise many questions and some of them are quite nonsensical you appear to be intelligent but confused you wanted to think for yourself and i personally like that im not sure where to go from here i would need more context in order to say more i can relate to you and thus i feel as if i want to give you a semblance of some sort of aid i would personally prefer to have never been born i cant give you any advice when it comes to extortion of suicidal thoughts but it seems as if you are as aforementioned confused and i would relish a chance to bring some matters into light
dota is an interest is it notout of curiosity why cant you leave
at first thank you for seeking help on here do you have any reasons for your suicide thoughts you should talk about the reasons the community and i will be here for youjust dont do anything you will regret later
ive been suicidal for the past number days and from my experience suicidal thoughts are in response to simply not wanting to be in painand so from my experience the best way to minimise thinking about suicide and to not think about it is to find a way to not be in pain whether thats done by distraction im a big gamer painkillers i find that numbernumber units of alcohol works as a painkiller for me but i am a happy drunk its a situational defence and it may tired well not work or even exacerbate suicidal feelings in others or being surrounded by happy things spending time with friends family but this is much harder to guarentee and to have it when you need itfrom what i know the tldr of suicidal thoughts is an extreme reaction to extreme pain and so painkiller activities are what i would recommend though the actual activities that would probably help would most likely be fairly specific to youi would also recommend contacting a suicide hotline specific to where you live but i know googling suicide automatically brings up a hotline number at the top of the pageim here if you want to talk about things either on here or somewhere else from my experience ive not yet been able to get rid of the thoughts just put more important things ahead of themhope that this helped even if it was just for someone to hear you
i totally get this i have suicide death fantasies at least a dozen times a day somehow ive made it into my thirties though and oftentimes now im able to laugh at the little fantasies im not quite as smart as you but im in the hood the biggest thing about smart is that its not good for much if you dont give a shit its like being super strong but you dont feel like lifting anything heavier than number lbs all i can say is to try to enrich your life youre like an oak sapling that has no nutrients sunlight figure out what interests you and do more of it
i spent number months in another country and it got me to last few steps to point where im okay depression vise also i wanted to say that you might not be as alone as you feel your feelings are not wrong in any way but this beast of a depression sometimes makes us feel like we are more alone and worthless than we objectively are it doesnt make it feel better but i think its still good to know
another thing about therapists i m too self conscious and focused on trying to say the right stuff i tried five different people for several seasons two lasted half a year and each time im upright and leave just as unsettled as i enteredmeet ups blind people dont understand what is like to be deaf and deaf dont understand what its like to be blind they get frustrated when communicating with me because of the differences since try to learn and do make it work my bf is totally bind but can hear hes the most understanding when it comes to communicating but depression he didnt have patience even when i try to explain especially since he knows whats like to be depression and suicidal
well it happened once it can happen again dont close yourself to new opportunities sometimes number minutes is all it takes
i really doubt i ever will find anyone else no one else ever cared about me that way why should it happen again now i just dont think im good enough to warrant that sort of interaction with someone and it seems thats the only thing i find even somewhat fulfilling hows being a parent
how are you feeling today better than before i hope can we help you go through things
no problem i didnt expect an immediate reply just wanted to check seeing a counsellor sounds like good progress they can help you come up with a plan it is possible sometimes to start a year again if needed or if you can just work out what youre going to do and write it down then maybe that will help so you can have a plan and stick to it for education and maybe also for what you want to change personally i supposeim still not sure about the disgustingness feeling disgusting and being disgusting are different i dont think most people call anyone disgusting it would be a bit mean but when assessing yourself i suppose its possible to be tired harsh if its a weight gain thing then maybe you can draw up a new routine to go along with your studies and just make sure you number stick to it eating less but still enough seems to work easier than doing masses of exercise they say you cant outrun your fork i cant anyway so for a routine like get up eat a b or c study whatever go for a walk internet eat something i dont know something like that but better i think living by your own rules gets rid of routine i put on weight and had no discipline to study when i left home its hard but you can do it because you want it not that youre not doing it already i dont know what your routine isnot sure if thats helpful or just annoying good luck
i wish i had some answer i hope you keep talking though and reaching out
probably addiction now use to smoke because it would get me out of the tunnel open my mind up make music effect me more it stopped doing that for a while so when it came back recently its probably the only reason i havent tried again even after attempting quite a few times lately im thinking just being able to stay stoned for a while and experiencing that feeling i love so much nonstop for my final days would be nice ending it on a good note
it makes me uncomfortable which ultimately makes them uncomfortable theres no cheering up you can do for me i have already lost the genetic lottery and will be repulsive for life
a lot of my experience with cbt admittedly limited i didnt find it as useful as a more psychodynamic approach was focused on separating this voice and using mindfulness practices to separate this second critical voice from the one i consider to be my true voiceim not sure if this would be helpful but it is most certainly an option i think lot of people struggle with a part of themselves that wishes they could be better because thats a natural human drivein certain cases i think that voice is just too loudwhats important to remember for me is that being louder doesnt necessarily make you more correcthope this helps
what if you dont die it will just make it worse im not here to tell you to look at rainbows or go travel but i want you to think about afterwards ive put a gun in my mouth and squeezed the trigger safety ended up being on it social fear the shit outta me i cant tell you it gets better but it does get easier the human race is a strange kind the inner strength we have is amazing you just have to find it
its not easy for me i got my first real friends when i was number and i still dont know what im doing if i were you which i obviously arent i would try to find some hobby group for something you are passionate maybe having mutual interest might help in process
the day is a cruel and blatant inyourface reminder to anyone who doesnt have someone of just precisely how alone they are i get that but im also wondering whether there are other options around this
i started tearing up with happy tears because you decided to save yourself i sincerely hope that life gets better for you from now on
i know exactly what youre going through and i dont really have any advice actually if you come across any i could use it too i pretty much rely on online friends at the moment its sad and pathetic but at least they are real friends in the sense that we care about each others lives i know you cant choose where your online friends live and it might be a bit exploitive but maybe you could try giving priority to those close by so you guys could hang out not that i am one to advise nearly all the people ive bonded with online just happened to live in europe maybe youve got better luck thats why i thought this getpeersfacebook strategyd help anyway the point is youre not alone youll find someone wholl really understand all this and who you could hang out with itll be great
well this is a throwaway but im a regular redditor i wouldnt mind staying in touch after all you did help me here perhaps theres a way to privately send you my actual reddit name pm me i suppose
well the va will give you all the psyche shit you could ever need and for free you need to apply for service connection for all of you conditions that way you can get treatment for them for the rest of your life also they give you money but yeah man go for the medical discharge from what it sounds like you should be able to get one
out of interest have you considered that it might play a part in your depression i smoked every day for number years recently stopped and the world is very different i do a million more things than i ever did all of which seem to give me a sense of purpose and meaning try checking out rleaves if you dont feel that way no harm no foul just my number cents
you had interest before what happened what changed
first off youre a teen your parents expecting more then what you can do is unfortunately expected my mom would always compare me to my cousin and i let it affect a huge part of me which was a big mistake as for the world if you dont hyperactive behavior the way it runs try to change it maybe not the whole world but your neighborhood school etc if you dont hyperactive behavior people thats your own choice im extremely introverted and i would much rather be alone for most of the time
i can relate a lot i push people away before they have a chance to reject me and i know that they will because im bad at talking i live with my parents still dont have a job etc etc this defense mechanism prevents me from making friends and girlfriends which just makes me more ashamed which inturn prevents me from going out i got stuck in this vicious cycle which is damn hard to get out of maybe youre in it toothere is this stigma in usa that living with your parents is bad i hate it and i think it makes a lot of people tired unhappy i grew up in europe and its no big deal its infact tired common for families just to build another house right on top of their parents houses over there my advice other than what everyone has already said is to talk to your parents be able to chat and have a normal time in the house at least i also live with people i stopped talking to and i think that this sort of forces me to be morbid all the time like i have to wear a mask im finding this tired hard to break though because its just been the way it has been for so long i think subconsciously im thinking i have to be sad and depressed i shouldnt be happy about my situation i dont know if this is the same case for you
ive been joking more and more often about suicide lately it makes the thought of suicide easier to cope with as in it makes it seem like less of a monster and more easily dealt with its like a coping mechanism
anything that people will remember me for after im gone ive done some things in my life that younger me never thought i would have accomplished but none of it keeps the memory of me alive for tired long im a musical prodigy according to others but that doesnt really get me anywhere i want to be i cant make a career out of that to allow the memory of me to continue on
well your opinion matters to me and its worth something whats been going on
im completely new to this subreddit but as only one other person has commented ill post something my friend maybe youre thinking too far ahead just think about what you can do today and perhaps tomorrow to improve your situation you already made one step by going to work out how are you feeling now
heroin seems like the only option in my mind right now its something i know im good at and its the only thing in years thats made me feel anything but depressed and it finally dawned on me that i dont have the guts to do anything with a knife or a gun but i could just as easily poison myself to death with a needle i actually never should have kept a single rig as a reminder i dont know what i was thinking
seroquel also gave me dyskinesia it got so bad at night i could barely fall asleep since then ive switched meds and its stopped for the most part
do you honestly really give a shit that they think youre annoying you shouldnt it shouldnt matter what they think as long as youre happy having fun fuck the people that talk shit about you we all have our insecurities and im guessing that what they said hit a nervebadlybecause youre posting here in rsuicidewatch but please dont let a few college twats get the best of you the only opinions you should take into account are those of the people that really love and care about you the ones that look out for you and if you feel youre lacking those im here to listen
heyif you need to talk im willing to listen whats going on
you beg to differ on what i most certainly am happy to be talking to youi remember my first photo i actually liked an odd realization indeed to see myself do something i admired others for doing what kind of photo was it do you still like it when looking back i am looking at mine now and find it a bit dull
what kind of world we live in if nobody was willing to help each otherlife is such a precious gift if youre having a hard time its up to you to try your best to get yourself on trackits so easy to let your troubles pile up but no matter how big that pile gets you can always walk around it it just may take some timewe dont need to know you to understand that your life is precious and that we care about you we care about you because most of us have been there ourselves and sometimes just reaching out can make all the difference in the worldi truly hope you reconsider
just be look at how you are thinking hereive never been good at anything i suck at school sports arteverything i have considered suicide on and off pretty much since i was numberim number now i never had friends tired long they always decided they didnt like me and stopped talking to meeach of these thoughts is self enforcing they were created by you and fed by you and they will cease to exist when you stop feeding into them it is a negative thought cycleno self respecting person accepts negative thoughts negative emotions or negative people try to see the good in everything to watch nice things and be around people who give you positive feelingsif your boyfriend is just sticking around for the money well then that doesnt sound tired positive does it only you can know if he contributes positive value to your lifebut how foolish it is to assume that by going through the same psychological cycles that things would improve life works in cycles everyones goes to work goes home and watches tv that is hardly unusual nowadaysthe difference is people can deal with that because they dont think negative thoughts about themselves you have to close the doors to all negativity it is up to you when you open the doors to negative emotion then it will sap you greatlyspend some time around your mother see the positive in your relationship with her she can teach you a lot but you have to be willing to learn
okay i just didnt want you to think that i disappeared on you in the middle of our conversation i really like the name hope thats really cute she sounds like shes been a good kitty to you through all of this not being able to open up to people around you who may be important to you sounds tired lonely i think youre strong for taking care of yourself through this all since i am worried about your safety im wondering if theres a service in your area that you could reach out to to help you with the burden for now im not sure if seeing a therapist or going to a doctor would be an option for you im worried that something might happen to you while hope is alive and she wont have anyone to care for her anymore
bullfuckingshit sorry but youre probably important to so many people that you dont even realize it one of my ex coworkers committed suicide last summer and its still affecting me today we werent friends just acquainted yet im still not over it another friend to who i havent spoken to in probably number years when i was about number died in a car drug withdrawal syndrome in february and i still think of him almost every day you are so much more important to so many people that its insane
youve been mistreated horribly in a way that you or anyone for that matter definitely do not deserve its not an indication that youre not worthy of love nor is it an indication that you will not find love if it doesnt already exist for you but i bet it feels pretty helpless right now
i guess i should try and ask more questions directly so here goes when did you guys find out you had depression anxiety whatever else we might have for me i remember being in numberrd grade i realized i was different from everyone else i always held back because of fear and i prefered to be alone even at an early age didnt have many friends simply because once i left school i just wanted to be alone and its always stuck with me depression appeared when i was numbernumber attempted suicide over a girl from then on was against suicide over a loved one but soon came to realize no one is exempt from the pain use to think suicide was a cowards way out because of how society has brainwashed us saying its the easy way out have you attempted suicide before even in a tunnel of despair suicide is pretty fucking difficult to get yourself to do its a war between our minds and our instincts but my instincts have been wrong before panic attacks over talking to people thats suppose to happen when i see a bear in the woods and am about to get mauled thats when the adrenaline should kick in not when i see a pretty girl and have to run and avoid her my instincts are flawed and they are fighting my mind this is a eternal battle thats why people get tired why they give up why its known as mental illness because its just an endless fight as long as we live death is not a black reaper with a scythe its a woman smiling glowing bright holding out her hand comfort and peace
definitely its many decades away but fuck i dont want to be an old man im not even in my numbers yet but i still think fuck im going to be old one day an old decrepid fuck im going to live a boring monotonous life and one day ill be a old man if you think no one cares about you now just you wait until your old youll see how little care people have for youupside is ill probably succumb to suicide way before then probably before i even get to number damn it mum why didnt you just abort me
hey sorry to hear youre doing badly but the ache of the relationship will eventually fade i can promise you that we have all had the experience of loosing a loved one if you want to chat and whatnot give me a shoutwhatever you decide to do i hope you end up happy from itwill be thinking about you and wishing you wellelzithxxxxx
i think that the main reason the police havent yet gotten involved is the corrupt nature of small town politics his father has connections in the police department not to mention that his grandfather is a judge we were attempting to get him emancipated but the obstacle of his grandfather coupled with the slim chance of success led us to abandon that plan of action the reason that my teachers praise detracts from my ability to write well lies in the self consciousness that plagues me when im complimented i feel hyperactive behavior i have to constantly meet or surpass her expectations to further feed the affirmation that i crave i really do enjoy cooperating with my friend to achieve our mutual goals but more and more it seems as if he is taking advantage of me when i come up with a new scheme he subtly attempts to accredit it to himself that could just be me being paranoia however i want to help my other friend as well but i havent the slightest clue how i dont hyperactive behavior playing the guitar all that much but i dont want to disappoint him i listen to music often to help sedated state my nerves specifically when i have thoughts of suicide i mostly listen to ambient piano or electronic music but i have a wide array of tastes i also read a lot going outside and meditating seems to be working wonders however the peacefulness that results is usually fleeting i appreciate you listening for this long talking really seems to bring some relief im not really looking for you to solve my problems but an outside perspective is always valuable in situations hyperactive behavior these i also hope you dont mind the sudden change in tone from the previous replies i just dont have opportunities to write out hyperactive behavior this to another person much especially on reddit where im likely to be labeled a thesaurus warrior even though seldom use one
i know friday might seem like its far away now but please just hang in there if you give up now youll never get to transition and youll never get to feel as comfortable as i know you deserve were all rooting for you
i think leaving the job is probably what i most need to do but im terrified of itfor starters any other job i am currently capable of meaning that doesnt force me to interact with people in person is going to come with the same pitfallsi feel like i need a serious break from work like a year to heal from all the shit that has happened to me but i dont have anyone who is willing to help me ive considered staying with my parents but i think that will only make matters worsei keep fantasizing about picking up and traveling for a while focusing on getting in shape while i am on the road documenting it maybe but im scared scared of not being able to find a job on the other side of it scared of becoming destitute in the process id like to hope i flatulencewind up doing this before killing myself but it is hard frightening and ive already said a lot about my current loss of motivation and fear
i did have a therapist for a couple of year but it didnt really seem to help the problem
i know it can be frustrating and it may take a long time but believe me you need to keep trying even with no experience youll find something at least something temporary until you find something better for youlike i said you should talk to her she may be scared of talking about it she may not know how to approach you about it you should do it instead and see what she has to say

ive tried that ive tried phobia social workers at school ive tried pediatricians ive tried psychiatrists it all always just leads to disappointment
what it means to be a human being varies from one person to another and what i feel is that you and i end up disappointed at people when they tell us were wonderful for being there when no one else was because weve set our standards higher we believe that people should help each other out and that it is not only the right choice but the only way people are supposed to treat one anotherpeople can suck its just a more productive use of your time to focus on yourself by being there for others and being empathetic youre setting an example for others to follow
no my family wants me gone my ex husband is a douchenozzle and would use this against me if he found out i have no friends the only people who ever want to hang out with me only do for sex

you arent worthless no one is worthless what are your interests i can personally train you in a few things you wont drag her down with you if you dont let it happen your daughter needs you and you are already doing her many favors by simply being in her life
you be in the same place but without the ability to draw on other peoples influence and experience and learn from it youd still be an awesome guy when you feel better come back and offer advice to someone else insert lion king circle of life quoteif you ever need anyone to talk to hit me up
you should try to love yourself see maybe you fucked everything up in your opinion but you did it with the intention of being a good person we have little control over what happens with us in our lifes at least partly but we shouldnt blame ourselves for example you are trying to get a job its not that you are too lazy or just cant be asked you should love youself for that you do care about your childrenhow many people dont do that you should care about yourself because you are a good person its just that shit happened to you that was for most parts out of your control please get rid of that part in your thinking that says you dont deserve things or that you are not worth it unfortunately this is just conditioning we are told from young age how to be and what it means to be worthy of living in society etc to be honest fuck all that in my book it only counts how well your intentions are if you are a good person with good intention you deserve to be loved so love yourself
please please please dont do this for any number of reasons pleasefirst off your death will be a far greater burden to your friends than any of your problems ever could be you seem like a person who is incredibly concerned with the wellbeing of others and this is the only reason i am starting here please understand how much the loss of you will affect their lives please understand that they will forever blame themselves and wonder what they could have possibly done differently to change how you felt again this is not to add to your misery but to appeal to the incredible concern you seem to have for others they care about you for a reason i am not transgender so i cannot personally relate to the turmoil that brings but i did spend about number months in san francisco working with a group that focuses on transgender economic empowerment have you ever considered moving there is that something that is even remotely feasible you would be shocked by how accepted and respected you would be there the citys attitude towards the transgender community was easily my favorite thing about the being there additionally the group i worked with was geared towards helping transgender people find employment there i obviously cannot guarantee anything im not in sf anymore but i would love to put you in touch with them not only that but there are organizations there to help you afford your hormonessweetheart please dont take that condescendingly you are little older than number your life should be full of mistakes and fuckups even beyond that age fucking up is part of life for the people you love so much please please please do not pain yourself they will never ever get over it and someone with your kind heart has so incredibly much to contribute to this world please feel free to pm me anytime best of luckas an addendum please try to get on other meds ones specifically geared towards treating depression i was thisclose to suicide for much of my life until i found the right combination for me it is wellbutrin and lexapro i still cry for the lost little girl i used to be and for all i would have missed out on if i had never found my way out
what guarantee do you have that you wont be able to overcome this your only frame of reference is from this perspective of despair and so naturally your assumptions are bound to be negative youve said it yourself if you make it through this itll be much better the only reason why you believe it isnt worth it is because you are mired in this perspectivedepression is a vicious cycle and i understand how your mind is battling against itself but life is a huge fucking experience and your frame of experience is infinitesimal compared to the rest of your life span how can you be so sure of anything when youve only been alive for number years how can you be so sure of your potential to overcome this when youve only been emotionally and socially conscious for barely half that time shit at this age your body hasnt even finished developing im number and im still figuring shit out about myself youre going to prom with your friend are you not why do you think thats going to be so terrible
its not so much about giving someone reasons as it is showing them that theyre reason for not arent as good as they think like you cant tell someone you know nothing about that friends and love is super awesome when they might be much more attuned to being lone wolfs that prefer to live in the forest and befriend loyal animals some people put career over family everyone is different thats what makes everything so hard an answer isnt really an answer so much as a potential hinted suggestion an upward inflectioned maaaybeee diisssi tend to over simplify everything to make things as easy as i can if someone is sad the first thing they should do is go sherlock on that shit and get to the bottom of it deduce the reason for being sad figuring out the cause is the most important part of pursuing a solution i hyperactive behavior to think most people that are sad can do this on their own usually the problem isnt as difficult to see as once they start looking the big problem is when they cantdepression has many causes it can stem from so many variables maybe its your life situation maybe its a rocky relationship maybe its a hidden medical problem maybe its a genetic defect maybe its a chemical imbalance maybe its simply a vitamin d deficiency seeing problems in your life are far more visible than most the rest of these things and even professionals arent always interested in getting to the root of the cause the first psychiatrist i talked to talked to me for number minutes and was already willing to prescribe me brain altering drugs in that short span of time so for a lot of people the struggle really is finding someone genuinely interested in helping them not doping them up to ensure steady appointments to help pay off their summer home if i made a list it would look hyperactive behavior thisnumber yourselfnumber friendsnumber family maybe personally i have closer relationships with friendsnumber religious authority figure if you follow a particular faithnumber therapist talk to a couple till you find one that hits your fancy a therapist cant prescribe drugs usually they mostly listen and provide feedback and everything said is confidential good ones are willing to work with you if you dont have insurance or its not covered by your insurancenumber doctor get blood work done and a general check up maybe something internal is on the fritznumber psychologist id only suggest them as a last desperate resort hopefully a good one that doesnt try to prescribe pills to you in the first number minutes find one that is more interested in finding the root of the problem then blanketing it or enuring job securityi dont discount the possibility that an individual can have solid well thought out valid reasons to not live however since there is so much a person can do to fixworkimprove their life that it makes your head spin its incredibly incredibly rare even going into the extremesthis isnt for the syncope of heart and if medical abnormalities make you queasy then i suggest you ignore this next sentence google dede koswara heres is a man i might say miiiiight have had good reasons if he ever even had any at some point but once his story broke out people the world over reached out and showed this man people are amazing its hyperactive behavior he stood on the edge of an ocean and couldnt swim then everyone voluntarily threw themselves into the water to form a bridge to help him get to the other side now he has aspirations to marry some day and see his grandchildrenit goes to show the lengths the better side of humanity will go to to help another with the rapid advancement of medical science i dont think its outside the realm of possibilities that dede will some day be cured of his affliction if this man can stay positive and hopefuli think most the population naturally has a programmed desire to live and preserve life especially mammals its a hypothermia natural instinct thats difficult to overcome all the people that have attempted to here and either pulled themselves back or looked for any reason not to should be proof of that its a powerful force of nature in all of us we wouldnt be here now as a species without it i hit a deer number years ago coming home from christmas at night going number mph totaled the car deer got up and actually made a run for the tree line almost made it would have made it if it could in a way were kinda hyperactive behavior terminators i can not self terminate lol thats hilarious anyway im all done sorry for being so long winded i hope some of it was insightful though for you have a better year this year good luck
thank you i am so chest pain by this it was all so unexpected and considering a couple of days before that both my parents were numbered to the hospital with an hour of each other there is just so much going on in my life
i feel selfish because i want to die like a little kid who pouts in the corner because he didnt get what he wanted im being selfish because i dont try to make things change because id rather just end things theres just so much ache and sadness and it just keeps getting worse not better ive been told to see a therapist before but im social fear to even do that im afraid of people the only reason i have friends is because i met them online and theres a sort of anonymity you can have when you talk to people that way even when i met my ex in person for the first time i was awkward and quiet when im online i can pretend to be happy funny interesting someone im not but i cant fake who i am in person which is basically why i got dumped my real life self wasnt the same all the ache and sadness i have is completely my fault and if i end it the problems go away forever

dont do it man seriously this is making me sad i dont know you but i feel like youve got something to offer everyone does maybe not now maybe next year but some time you will figure it out my dad killed himself in his numbers we all miss him dearly he didnt think anyone wantedneeded him anymore and his body was failing if he only knew how much we pain now many years after

you know what i love about my college courses all of my professors admit to being fuckups before they got into their second year of college my all time favorite professor admits to being only a few levels away from being mentally handicapped in drug abuse school but after she found her passion she went on to get a doctoral degree and published an awesome ethnography on sex in the caribbean the change in environment is key if you can do me one favor dont kill yourself until youve at least tried to experience college the language youre using makes it patently obvious that you really dont want to end it what youre craving is a major life change you and i both know what a great community reddit is have you ever thought of checking out rfitnessrfitness or some other activity based sub by keeping your body active youll take a lot of pressure off of your mind as well as prove to yourself that you can make progress etc while video games are a great way to dull your senses they dont really do much for you in the long run and its easy to get down on yourself about itdude if you have an interest in those fields you should check out paul farmers biography mountains beyond mountains also im not sure what your religious background is but if youre anything else hyperactive behavior the rest of reddit and have a penchant for nihilism you should check out sam harris hes an absolutely brilliant neuroscientist that gives some awesome arguments against religion using your fieldwork ethic doesnt matter in drug abuse school really man its all bullshit and youll realize that as soon as you get to college its much easier to work at things you lovehave an interest in plus science majors always stick together because of how difficult it is all of the bio and med students i know know every other biomed student and they all hang out together plus at least at my school theyre all pretty cool people and love to have a good timethe point is to survive the now though right what sort of plan could we put together that would help you enjoy your summer
try the revenuesharing sites where you can write different stuff although payments gonna be long time if you dont go online much you could try bubblews where everyone talks about anything and where you can get something off your chest
its odd you mention faith but talk about suicide im with you though i think theres something to be said about a couple that goes the distance probably why im not married myself i havent read the bible in a long long time but i dont find its reasonable by dealing in such absolutes or offering a guide on how to handle a failing relationship more of a grin and bear it no matter how sad and depressed mood it makes both of you human beings are fickle we can believe one thing today and another a month from now we can think someone is perfect for us and realize latter theyre not it is no ones fault its in our nature however i do think its more than possible to find that person that will go the long haul with you i irritable mood you can see couples that have done it its a definite possibility and simple lol matter of finding itif you do decide some day to be loved again this experience will have taught you a great deal you could employ in your next you can try to insure the next one is seriously in it to win it to grow old with you and help you spoil your grand kids dont be in such a rush to put a ring on someone that beyonce song is a load of crap you can get a better feel for things next time see if her parents are still together kids with their original parents generally try to make a relationship work because thats what they grew up around more so if even their grandparents are still together it is what the know to do ingrained from birth anyway i hope you decide to try again you cant be a man of faith up until it stops suiting you i would also have to mirror what the others have said of your children i dont know what ages they are but giving them money and them knowing how to invest it wisely are two separate things my brothers girlfriend lost her mother to a traffic accident she doesnt work she wont ever work she lives off a trust fund made from her mothers life insurance money she hasnt grown into an respiratory distress syndrome adult incredibly immature she isnt progressing and growing as an individual because shes been exempted from having to deal with real life problems hyperactive behavior dealing with irritable mood coworkers or not getting her way number of the time dont let her know this but shes a terrible human beingi mentioned kids who grew up with their original parents are used to following in their footstepsurl loss of your life will leave significant ripples it will have negative repercussions and inflict a deep wound its part of my inability to understand why you want to give up you have way way too much now that i dont see how you could have the luxury of taking your life anymore it would cause an incredible amount of paini understand not wanting to be around to see her happy ho boy that would suck of course thats assuming she actually gets to be happy thats something thats kinda up in the air if she isnt someone willing to make relationships work shell have a far harder time with it then you will anyway you dont have to die to never see someone again kids and trading custody stops when the youngest is over number right then you wont ever see her again with some luck because she isnt dropping the kids off anymore she doesnt even have to get out of the car and see you she could even make them walk from up the street you can put further distance between each other as well i irritable mood ive seen people at the grocery store a mile down the road that ive never seen again ever you dont have to go to such extremes as shutting your eyes and singing lalalalalacanthearulalala to block someone out its much more easier than that this is most assuredly a low spot in your life but you have many potential drug abuse spots to look forward to if you allow it im guessing your kids are still young you seem to have gotten the short stick and ended up as the disciplinary parent lol your wife the fun one well just as humans are fickle so to especially are kids they cant see that what you do for them is actually for their benefit until theyre old enough to reflect back on it and put the pieces together
would you mind going into details
im sorry to hear thatits really gone beyond being with her its more to the point that i have to put a brave face on and help her while im falling apart on the inside before i just used to blame the depression for all my problems but now i am tired much aware that i in fact cause most of them i can see myself making the bad decisions feeling sorry for myself not doing things to improve my situation but i cant stop myselfits almost like watching someone else ruin my life except its me and ive been doing it for number of my number years here i was just completely oblivious before but now im painfully aware
i hope i can put it in a tired direct way there is nothing worse that you could do for your daughter than killing yourself please stay with us everything youve done is forgivable whats something youre ashamed of
denying it for a long time means that you were scared to admit it which is understandable i have my moments that im still denying it but when i dont i see everything more clear and want to do something with my life i think living healthy helps a lot you may not see it right now but the longer you keep it up the better youll feel the sleeping yeah you know just like this disease the sooner you accept that youre sleeping less hours one day and the other day youre sleeping more it doesnt matter its not realistic to sleep the same amount of hours every night the more you accept it the more peace you will have in yourself try to build up a routine for yourself have a long shower drink hot milk switch your phonelaptop off think about how your day went look forward to tomorrow in times when everything is overwhelming go outside for a walk breathe count till number enjoy the air and make sure you are taking care of yourself tell yourself that it is okay to feel however you are feeling try stuff out that you feel comfortable maybe go and excersise cook something just anything that will help your racing thoughtshope this helps a bit not the best at giving advice haha
they said all the normal ways you would think to calm down or not get angry nothing special its like everyone things im stupid and need to learn things i already know
yours is a problem of chronic overwork and chronic underappreciation these are short term problems yours is a injury of muscle solutionyou say you hate your family and have no problem leaving them to rot have you thought of doing that just drive away drop the car off at the nearest lot take your number for it and hop on a greyhound to anywhere elsetry that first if it makes you feel better keep trying take care of you for a change maybe that means panhandling maybe that means day labor who knows if it makes you feel worse then you do care about your family and you care about leaving them in the lurch and they need to know that theyre killing you and that you cant carry them any moreyou need change that much is clear but change does not mean death
yeah i think its pretty fun but admit that its not for everyone yeah having things kind of spring up on you can be really hard to deal with yeah it does seem like making yourself not feel the pain would make you feel empty having all that work too sounds tired strenuous
yeah most of my friends havent really said what they would do if i were to kill myself they just hate talking to me about it for fear that something they say will make everything worse they dont really understand and dont seem to be willing to listen which gets frustrating for both parties its just that being depressed mood and feeling suicidal has just become more or less my identity its what i spend all my time doing and i lose ways to relate to them theyre all off in school most of them still in engineering and whenever i see them and they start to talk about school i just feel hyperactive behavior crap im immediately filled with regret that i chose to not go to the same university among a number of other things and it really sucks because one of these friends is someone ive wanted to ask out for a long time but she gets really annoyed at me when im in a bad mood and says it makes her feel guilty and just isnt willing to talk things over shes been avoiding me for the past while which hurts quite a lot im the type of person who just completely attaches himself to someone or something and its just immensely frustrating that i put myself through this even though i know better
im here seriously im here if you want ill give you my phone number and you give me a call and i expect you to say hi proudly because im proud to have a person hyperactive behavior you consider me a friend and trust me enough im proud to live a life where total strangers trust me that to me is more humbling than anything gift in the universe were all in this together we are every time you fuck up we all fuck up every time you accomplish something however minor we all feel the damn pride of accomplishment words may be cheap in some context but from reading yours i could already surmise the type of man who could write such words and that mans pure awesome so stop looking at your problems as problems but as temporary challenges blocking you from happiness what that happiness is ive no idea but i can tell you that my happiness sometimes is the joy of being able to get coffee and being able to say hi to random strangers on the street and fully get a hi back youre in a position where you have enough financial abilities and freedom to do something amazing pick up a hobby go cosplay build a suit i always wanted the ability to do cosplay but im currently attending school and i dont have the time nor the money to invest in such an endeavor but you you my fine sir you are amazing in every way im not so come on buckle up dont be afraid to reach your hand out thereif youre lonely meetupcom if youre bored meetupcom if you want an experience meetupcom unless you want to be where you are your entire life you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations and make that situations so damn comfortable you keep going backlook not everybodys destined for global greatness or international fame or a stellar nobel prize some people are destined to be greatamazing fathers mothers brothers sister ceos neighborhood gossip etc you have the ability to be amazing in every single way you want dont ruin that possibility by comparing yourself to some phobia social addicts who get nothing but temporary enjoyment out of life personally i find myself absolutely happy when im sitting with a friend on sunday at some obscure cafe playing chess and sipping coffee you you can do anything put yourself in an uncomfortable situation and make it so damn comfortable talk just talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talktalktalk to everybody you see eventually i know this eventually theyll talk back and well youve made it youve made a marker in the universe i cant wait for you to thatpm me if ever youre looking for somebody to talk to i do not shy away from company besides youve more wisdom than i do i wont shy away from that learning experience or if youre really badass expand concentrate on your business and give back to the community when you make it big oh man thats always been one of my dreams
not gonna lie its not as easy as stop feeling worthless then it will take time but talk to people good friends parents siblings or even people online that are willing to try and help people if you have a good doctor then talk to them and try to get some antidepressants
hey when i was numbernumber i dated a numbernumber year old guy online actually we dated on and off until a couple months ago im number now and while we did dirty talk and all that i dont feel violated or abused or anything from those exchanges if that helps at all i dont think youre a anger or fucked up even to be honest you seem hyperactive behavior a young guy with active hormones happens id say find a therapist itll be fine you havent done anything they can arrest you for as far as i know you just sound anxious get this shit off your chest man youre not a anger or a pedophile i believe that with all my heart you do sound upset and maybe a little lost and its perfectly okay to feel that way but you are a normal good spirited guy i can tell you deserve love and supportyou dont deserve to die certainly not to die feeling guilty and ashamed and anxious if you can find someone trained to talk to and maybe try to break through that isolation a bit it might be depressed mood you even if it feels safer im struggling with isolating myself too im sorry to hear youre having such a difficult time because you really do sound hyperactive behavior a sweet guy
possiblysorry about the empty post its sort of a hard subject to just jump intobasically ive been constantly delusional disorder at my uni for the past couple of months and it has been extremely detrimental to my mental health its especially bad when doing anything online when i most feel like im being spied on making it extremely difficult to reach out for help in any way i had to stop talking with one of my good friends online because the delusional disorder was so badthe whole situation makes me want to dissapear because of how much it makes me feel isolated with no chance that things will get better
i have met a lot of people in a lot of horrible situations and ive never seen a single one of them not be able to actually get out of it with a little bit of effortwhat is really interesting is the fact that you are taking joy in the fact that you wont meet anybody due to the fact that you dont want them to know that you are suicidal because you claim they would be disappointed in you do you irritable mood to tell me they would not be disappointed in you if you committed suicide the first step of conquering these feelings is to do it with people who care about you if you think that they would be upset with you confronting them about a matter that is so serious then you are wrongi had a cousin who thought the same exact thing is as you he didnt want to burden his family or his friends with his suicidal thoughts he did end up killing himself and we were all absolutely astonished by the fact that he made no effort to talk to us about it because we would have been there for himand now we are much more disappointed than we ever could have been if he would have confronted us with this matter then due to the fact that he decided to avoid us and kill himselfi want to make this clear suicide awareness is much more present today than its ever been and people understand the importance of helping people who feel that its an answeryou are worth something to someone you are worth something to many people around you people dont get disappointed in each other when we need help we get disappointed in each other when we dont seek help when it was available and do something localized rash generalised and irreversible think about ittake care
there are so many people in the world youre not aloneurl and you have so much those people waiting to be a part of your life you talk about perfection but all of us even the perfect struggle with perception of themselves and insecurities those of us real enough to understandits so easy to become isolated and insecure and lose track of just how great you are so many people drag themselves down feel trapped in the dark when all they need to do is open their eyes and look around youre still doing ok many people are going through struggles just hyperactive behavior yours living with your parents for example very commonurl such small things in life hyperactive behavior a single friend can make the problems we have with have insignificant and something hyperactive behavior that is guaranteed to come along for you and i think it would be abnormal behavior for you not to be here to take that loving friendship up and run with it
ah yeah street photography its not where i started but i do really like it there is a spontinaity to it that i really like if you dont live with him where do you live and in what circumstances sounds like your father is a real piece of work
one part of your reply really got to me the reason i think i came to my senses the last time was because of one person it wasnt my dad or brother or sister it was my mom i know that if i suddenly died it would hit her the hardest even if she was the one that paid the least attention to my sister when she told everyone i know my death would hit her the hardest shes put everything on me all her chips are on me im her last card in the deck my sisters more or less a failure one of my brothers is a failure and a douche bag my other brother is just generally the biggest prick i know i think i may be then last hope she has to have a successful child one that might be decently successful but is also nice well at least i bring more to the table than my other siblings morally wise i really dont think my siblings or dad would care if i was dead but theyd sure as hell care about my mom i dont irritable mood this in a im gonna kill my mom kinda way but im number sure that my mom would either kill herself or go completely mental disorders if i killed myself i think that might cause a domino effect because i think if my mom killed herself my dad would follow jesus i just read what i wrote and it sounds pretty fucking conceded to me i dont think hyperactive behavior this usually ive just been thinking about my death and what would happen and this is what i think might happen this is one of my mental depression spurts im usually happier than this its just something bad happened my sister kind of betraying me and i go into mental depression mode this is also the first time my family basically turned their back on me when i needed them most god this is long if you do reply to this i might not reply back instantly ive gotta finish this diary of anne frank book also thanks for the kind words i really appreciate it
i have to be honest with you you want that to happen and maybe we romanticize death the be that way oh he wouldnt want us to grieve but they will they will lose jobs end relationships cry themselves to sleep drop out of school develop insecurities ask themselves why again and again six years later at number o clock in the morning their lives will be irrevocably and permanently scarred by the ugly fact that what happened did effect them in an terrible and unfair way if you find yourself unsure if you can do it for you pm me and ill tell you all the reasons you can do it for them seriously it will ruin their lives forever
yeah my family knows my mom and sister are tired concerned i am tired loved but i cant handle this i cant go back to a psych ward i want to go to my doctor but fuck i cant handle all this pain i cant understand why everything kills me inside i should be happy i go from loving life to wanting to die in seconds once it starts its so hard to stop and it doesnt last long ive noticed i was different since numberrd grade i knew something was wrong and it just got worse and worse it went from just sleeping to constant suicide attempts i want a gun so bad it can do it so fast i wont feel this way anymore i need it
i guess because i can be discarded by others when i have nothing to offer i realised that most people use me so if i have nothing to offer i am suddenly alone and it pain its so pain to realised that when you have served your use you no longer have anyone near you even with that i know that the next time they ask i will still be there because i want to helpmy real life friend only answer when he need a place to stay a ride or something lile that i am renowned for not saying no because even if it pain me to know they are using me the fact that i can help is important to mewhen i get left behind like i am currently i am alone its so hard realising it and knowing i will be atuck in the same loop over and over and that no one really care about me
by all means do when you feel hyperactive behavior talking you always reply hyperactive behavior you said what she felt for you in the past but you havent talked about how you feel for her or what did you told her when she finally called or even what you felt when she called were you angry relievedjust clear your head i bet you are feeling really bad right now take a shower and go to bed that has always helped me in the past
even if you feel this way while with friends have him come over and hang out for awhile if you want to bawl your eyes out to him dont let shame hold you back i agree with him that you should send a simple text i need you can you come over then say how you feel as you posted here it might help especially if it will let him know that youve got these thoughtsits hard to constantly take care of ourselves so let others help care for you emotionally by just hanging out
im going to address your problems point by point i will label them in what i think the order of priority is ill give a very brief preamble of my lifei just turned number in october ive been depressed mood since the age of ten and thought about suicide since numbernumber i got a girlfriend senior year of hs went to university and dropped out during my numbernd semester said gf ventricular dysfunction left me a week prior to our one year and she shacked up with a friend i introduced her to i spiralled hard tried to take my life and was in the psyche ward for two weeks struggled with mental depression for about two years after that suicidal included but things are stable nownumber you will not be permitted to live with your parentsyou do not have a jobthis is what you need to deal with right now i personally think your parents are being little shits for threatening to kick you out at your lowest but no matter what you have to have a solution in the event you are going to get kicked out you need to find a place to live try to rent out a room from somewhere on kijiji or craigslist people have to be looking for one more roomie and if you can score a cheap place to live for a little while youll get freedom not the same type of freedom you think you have had but the freedom to be away from a parental structure that seems megacolon toxic if they arent fostering your well beingnumber you are dropping out of university and do not have a means of financial supportthis is a pretty obvious issue and something you should be able to remedy fairly easy youre going to be on your own soon and youre going to need to keep yourself afloat you can bug personalfinance on how to make it work but any sort of minimum wage job for a while should keep you afloat in your new dive the easy key is to try to work somewhere close to where you live if you have to walk bike take transit whatever do it as much as the job may suck its sort of a necessity to help fix the other issues eating you up once you have these two done as hard as it can be as much as it might eat at you at night this is when the hardest is over what comes next is the easy part the part that you dont have to work nearly as hard on to still get results the phobia social aspectnumber you have social anxiety and its hindering your chances at friends and prospective loversthe first thing im going to do is steal an idea from savage love im sharing the link before i quote him granted youre not a meth addict doing orgies but the root question is validurl you date you if you wouldnxenumberxnumberxnumbert date someone in the condition youxenumberxnumberxnumberre currently in glc then itxenumberxnumberxnumbers highly unlikely that anyone else would the idea that there are millions of single people seeking romantic relationships with train wrecks is a fantasy promoted by hollywood social anxiety mental depression is something i had for a while and its something i learned my way through im going to say here and now if you dont have any friends dont bother panic for girlfriends girls are and can be fun but if youre not the person who cant have any friends youre in no shape to find girlfriends im not saying this to be irritable mood im just pointing out an oftoverlooked aspect of girlsgirlfriends are girlfriends the same skills you will get to make friends and be a cool guy are the same that will be used for girlfriends if youre stuck at a minimum wage job youre going to be surrounded by people the key to getting through the day is to have something to talk about talk to other people ask questions nobody is going to bite your head off if youre curious how long theyve worked there nobody is going to snub you for asking what they did with their days off unless theyre a dick striking up conversation is pretending to care about somebody elses life and padding the imaginary resume of yours if you dont have any interests and just hypersomnia or masturbate all day youre not going to have any redeeming qualities to talk about for any guysgals you run acrossfriends are hard to make i think personally i have hyperactive behavior two or three but a lot of acquaintances and people i get along with its tough it sorta sucks but if you are interested in something youll eventually find somebody whos into it too the reason youll find somebody interested in similar things is because of this little secret as long as you dont kill yourself youve got time youve been alive for number years you should easily have another number years at least to find people who are into the things you areto your final paragraph heres my number suicide is always a way out but its almost never the best way out you may feel hyperactive behavior pressure is getting to you and everything is drug withdrawal syndrome down and ive been there before countless times but given enough time a solution makes itself clear
hi there ixcnumberxbnumberm half russian i know our country isnxcnumberxbnumbert always accepting stuff and people i know exactly what itxcnumberxbnumbers like to be poor and feel trapped however killing yourself will leave your family and friends devastated they need you and love youdo whatever you need to do to survive and trust me you will your thoughts can change your life
youre gonna die one day so dont let your life be about size unreal friends or romance the best years of your life are still to come they can be during your numbers numbers or even numbers so i think its a good idea that you want to join volunteer groups dont mind the people wholl pity you for your lack of experience life really isnt about that
its a good temporary relief im still looking for the proper cure myself maybe tomorrow has pretty much become my catch phrase if you ever want to talk let me know i can give you my email
thank you
i know what you mean but could you elaborate why you are at that point maybe not to tell me but it will help others help you just letting the internet know of intention will do no good im at that point so maybe we can relate
there are too few people in the world with a heart like you i need to know there are people like you around lifes too damn hard without knowing that you arent alone in that sense it it doesnt make me feel like such an alien in this world i hope that makes sense im sorry about your mom it angers me thats shes going through this and that your going through this youre not alone
actually i just started medication im a pretty rational person imo and im not going to just toss in the towel without trying all of my available options i have hopes for the pills i am taking yesterday was actually somewhat okay i smiled at the thought that i might smile
stay with us your life isnt over as bad as it feels right now i know youre probably tearing your hair out with anxiety mental depression right now but you did the right thing posting here now dont say goodbye yet keep talking what else do you hyperactive behavior to do what did you used to do for fun before you met your girlfriend or when she wasnt around
i have been looking for a job but the thought of leaving bed and being out in the world daunts me so i havent been trying very hard i know youre right though i cant continue existing this way
i will ask this and i apologize if it doesnt work are you immune to drugs or is it a mental thing are you messing with yourself so to speak ie if you believe the drugs wont work they wont often with depression drugs alone dont do the trick
in a weeks timelet me see my girlfriend broke up with me and i feel literally numberx shittier than i did before
im pretty sure they cant just lock you up hyperactive behavior that i hopeif you found counseling bad before try a different person you really have to get a good personality match with a counselor if they dont get you its just a waste of time please dont just give up it could make a huge difference for you and maybe tell the counselor youve had bad experiences before with counseling feeling hyperactive behavior you were being scolded
i hope you get a diagnosis this is really important to be able to communicate to your family you have a legitimate struggle not an excuse or lazinessyou are here and you have a potential to enjoy life which trumps a logical analysis of wanting or not wanting you dont choose to live nobody did but we discover who we can be as a result and whether we find difficulty there that can be seen as completely separate its okay to be in trouble and in need of help its human and common and normal if you are here for others then maybe its not so much to ask of yourself to try anything that will work to help yourself up it can be difficult to believe in yourself but its possible its always possible to move on from where we are and there is no shame in that
youre good enough youre strong i feel so similar to you i always try my hardest to make others feel better and know how important they are yet it rarely feels like anybody tries to make me feel better you arent small sometimes the kindest biggest hearts have the toughest struggle please know you arent alone if you ever need a kind word were all here for you
i have at this moment learned that my minorly schizophrenic friend and former girlfriendwhom i still have a huge crush on is contemplating suicide if you think that your family or friends thinking about how you need to repeat a semester is worse than the emotional upset trauma theyd get from finding you in a closet with a tope around your neck than i believe you need to get think again imagine it ten years from now if you dont commit suicide a woman in an abusive marriage or a man who had suffered from a near fatal infection caused by mal practice then imagine you being her divorce attorney or the lawer who sewed the hospital and not only got enough money to pay for the mans treatment but took this case so far as to have the congress pass a new law preventing this from ever happening again imagine the looks on their faces the woman smiling and crying with joy from beneath a bruised face the man grinning as he wakes from a successful treatment think about them whenever you think that youre ready to die and ask yourself what would the world do without you
maybe opening up and talking to these people would really help even if they do live far away they can still help you my best friend lives almost six hours away from me and we havent lived in the same town together since we were number but i know i can always call him if i need something and he knows he can always call me i think your friends and family will surprise you as for the transitional period boy do i feel you there im over halfway through college but im majoring in english and it is not fun to have everyone constantly tell you that the only job out there for an english major is a teaching position it makes me nervous for the future but im still hanging in there what are you planning on studying
how much aid do you need for a masters program
i think few people that comment here have any sort of official qualification but knowing there are people random strangers even that take time off their day to read your story and respond to it must in some way help those who come to this sub just listening and talking to suicidal people without judging them is really helpful already if you want to be of greater help then you can find a lot of internet resources with information on how to best comment to these people hyperactive behavior thisurl

youre right that its not simple life is difficult change requires work growth takes time oak trees and biceps dont appear overnightfeeling hyperactive behavior you are past the final straw and too burnt out to try again after so many failed attempts i can sympathise withwhat i would challenge though is some of your assumptionsmy life is always going to be a cycle of ineptitude incompteance and mediorcityno matter what has happened in the past i dont think you can preempt the future even if you have tried before you cannot say with absolute certainty that things will never changeeveryone seems to have some sense of normalcy in their lives except mei dont know who this is referring to its certainly not true in my experience depends who you are mixing with everyone is a strong wordit will never changesee abovenever is a strong word you can say that if you continue as you are that things are unlikely to change but the only time you can say categorically number that things will never change is if you are deadon a more macabre note if you irritable mood jumping off bridges in a literal sense please dont its painful but of course wed hope you dont consider any wayits true that modern society is not as accommodating as it should be to highly sensitive people but there are ways to channel it you can also work from home to avoid dealing with peopleyou strike me as quite young there is still time to have a new life
this is me to a t youre not stupid for feeling this way i know i will never be able to end myself see my first post to reddit under this name created todayso dont feel alone for me it comes and goes im just waiting for this spell to end one thing i normally do is not take care of people or do my chores however because my so had a bad fall today i made him coffee i felt somewhat marginally beter but not by much i was just a bit happy that i was able to help him in tha way if i remained lazy he wouldnt have that much needed coffee hes prone to narcolepsywhat im sayinghang in there
maybe you could just tell your friend what you have told us please try to see her you probably share a lot of the same problems im guessing kindred spirits so just letting her know that you know what its like could help maybe its all i can really do too but i can really relate to your situation and i feel your pain

i have a really weird onei listen to all kinds of music indeed there are tired few songs on this list so far i dont recognize but so far i find the majority of them to capture only the lows of this disorder the deepest fathoms rather than the everyday experiencefor me the song that best captures my everyday is thisurl i realize that electronic music generally gets a bad rap as far as serious discussions go but if you have a moment to listen id like to explain why i feel this waythe endless motion the ceaseless progress of the drums serve to carry me through it all no matter how i try to focus on the lyrics on the melody they feel vague and blurry subsumed beneath the formulaic progression of the beatthe few lyrics scream at me to open up while the simple melody at first summons hope daring the listener to continue on chasing twin promises of beauty and of loveyet once the final section begins that hope is dashed there is realization sorrow as the instrumentals build to a fever pitch all of a sudden the lyrics become a mantra rather than a goal that if i could only open up things might truly be better why cant i listen to myself follow my own advice its that easy isnt itif i could pick myself up would there be a happy ending is there enough fire within my heart to see the endi dont knowon that note does anyone else like huey lewis and the news xd

true that im a virgin in may aspects of life however im only trying to help ive lost someone in the past and i felt hyperactive behavior shit for the better part of a year best part is i didnt even know him that well we were acquainted thats all weather you think of me as an idiotic spoiled kid is irrelevant and it might sound hyperactive behavior a load of bs but think of what and who youre leaving i know you said you didnt care about others at this point but they still care about you

i am so tired sorry for your loss and i can only imagine what it must be like you can still talk with your dad and let him know how you feel his energy is still somewhere out there in the universe and someway your message will be received you might even get some sort of response to let you know hes still with you but what you need to ultimately do is forgive him for his decision it might take time to do so but it will help you tremendously

i may sound a bit offensive i dont know im not actively trying to be a dickmost of what you have said comes of to me as a load of feelgood jargon and i was expecting to hear that i was expecting someone to say something along the lines of hey youre right but just ignore the massive load of shit that is your life and just work hard and your life wont suck anymore its extremely commonim not stubborn at all my mind is open i look at facts i know the difference between subjectivity and objectivity i dont have any unsubstantiated beliefswhether or not something is beautiful is entirely subjective nobody is born with the will to ride motorcycles thats a preposterous claimim not sure what to say you are attempting to appeal to my emotions and while i appreciate the effort it doesnt appeal to me

it is true that there are people in this world who can love it is also true that millions of people dont find any love or comfort all their lives and suffer i cant do that i cant live a hurtful life i think i have given this world a fair chance waited number years given a chance for people to be fair with me luckily i dont owe anything to this world or the people here i can leave in piece i just want to die somewere where nobody will find my body or be able to identify it i dont think anyone has earned the right to mourn me i still love that girl and will do anything for her but she has decided to take me off her life more precisely she has decided to net be there when im suffering and be there with me only when she needs me
well that is a good thing cutting is a hard habit to break i used to do it a lot
i try to cut her off i have changed my number twice and she still gets it i just moved across the country and have no will power to do any of those things i work about number hours a week and i am just so mentally and emotianlly drained that i get in bed as soon as i get home i have been so nausea all weekend that i have barely ventricular dysfunction left my bed
thats pretty standard really i dont know about your friend and dont mean to belittle your friendship but an outpouring of sympathy after a death doesnt necessarily mean people knew much about the deceased or had any real concern for them while they were alive or perhaps they did but it was too long ago people for the most part are quite blind to others and communal grieving is a powerful cathartic thing that mostly exists for its own sake to someone suicidal who really feels friendless the thought of old acquaintances taking real notice of them is often part of the appeal in their minds theyre more useful dead than alive
hey i think im in a smiliar situation as you do you have any reasons for being depressed i know this question sounds dumb since there arent always reasons when you have a depression but if you have reasons feel free to talk about it the community and i will listen to youand take a look on the positive sides you wrote that a lot of people think your depression gets better so there are people who care about you you should pick one or two of them and just talk openly about your problems and you will probably see how much they care about you and if what i hope you dont do really kill yourself they will be destroyed and maybe get a depression themselves do you want the people who care about you fell the way you feelnow for the selfhamring part i too have been self harming for months i suggest you the butterfly project url it has really helped me although i cant promise that it helps everybody but its definitiely worth trying ittldr talk about your problems
you are number im number and i will trade you my life for your straight up car bank account age ect nothing matters when you are number you can fail school and you know what happens you get to do it all over again seriously even if you get kicked out of school you can still find a job a so some place to live and just have a life in general a happy one tooactually i think your problem is your parents they have bad habits that cause problems instead of prevent them they freak out about them and over the years you have learned to freak out about them mimicking your parents your mental depression and anxiety mental depression is a learned behavior when it comes down to it you could medicate it but can you medicate a learned behavior you need to spend time with people that have good habits and learn that shit
hi my name is beth and i am currently number i am from wales and lived here my entire lifei struggle with mental depression and anxiety mental depression from drug abuse school bullying and lack of phobia social interaction and borderline personality disorder caused by an emotionally abusive relationship my recent past has experienced my mothers death friends betrayal stalking bullies suicide attempts and cheaters my future though my boyfriend is incredibly supportive and amazing and i have been accepted into a wonderfully large group of thrilling and hilarious people even my phobia social ineptness has been accepted i just need to keep fighting and believe that it really does get betteri plan to request weening off my current antidepressants and therapy soonthis is meurl
id like to read some too you sound well read i guess a good writer
im number and feel the same way i think most suicides are irrational and do fit the description of a injury of muscle fix to a temporary problem this is especially true in younger people but in some cases i think suicide can be a rational decision i have spent a lot of time in introspection and i have come to the conclusion suicide is the best way out in my case im just too high inhibition to go through with it and so im stuck in a perpetual case of limbo in my case i have never experienced love or intimacy and im number im a virgin and not by choice more than that i have only grown more and more isolated as i got older i want to belong i wanted to have a normal life but the cards were stacked against me from the start and at this point i am beyond hope of ever having one thats not the only reason though thats just the tip of the iceberg i know im depressed have been for most of my life but in my case its endogenous depression only the external causes of my depression are not temporary there is tired little hope for them to chance
it does pay out if youve had your policy over number years
hey pls reply this comment really social fear me dont do anything localized rash generalised ok if shes not answering wait till you talk to her before doing anything if someone i knew killed themselves because i didnt answered my phone i think that would kill me
well after a couple of failed suicide attempts and a few owis i ended up stuck in jail because i didnt have anyone left who would bail me out i came off booze and benzos and all my psyche meds at once and started hallucinating in gen pop and got thrown in solitary eventually i got out and i went straight to st cloud mn where theres a va hospital that has a big substance abuse and ptsd treatment center and spent three months in there
nobody who is a decent psychologist and human being will ever tell you that youre not bad enough to get help you definitely deserve itdid you know that there are lots of different kinds of therapy certain kinds are thought to help more with specific kinds of problems it may also be the case that the counselors you saw just werent a good fit for you that happens please dont give up on seeking help because of ityou are not being a bitch i promise you first of all your problems are definitely worth help theres no reason to be ashamed of seeking help and anyone who will tell you otherwise really needs to reexamine how much sympathy they have for their fellow human beings second of all pain is relative just because other people have had worse things happen to them does not mean your feelings are invalidi know what it feels like to doubt that your problems are significant or to talk yourself out of doing anything about them i also know that looking for help or doing something to help myself almost always makes me feel a lot betteryou mentioned selling your gun that might be a good idea it sounds to me like having that gun readily accessible is dangerous for you not having it around might keep you from making an impulsive decision to pain yourself not to mention the fact that if youre worried about being able to pay for a psychologist having the extra money cant painyoure in badass mode remind yourself that feeling suicidal is kind of like living with a monster and being able to defeat it and live your life again is pretty badass fuck anyone who tells you that its asthenia to get help or that your problems arent worth it youre a badass thats why you can make it through
well i guess you cant blame her for freaking out she could have had you hospitalized if she wanted why are you suicidal

you just said your friend would blame herself dont do that to her
i find most things that allow me to think just put me in a depressed mood mood music being one of them i tend to play games instead it sucks that you feel you cant go to your family im currently looking into therapy as expensive as it is ive tried it and hated it before but i dont have a hell of a lot of options here
as you get older you will have more options and things will get better youll get out of your parents home you wont have to be around the bullies at school just try to hang on for a little while longer youre already number so you dont have long to go keep your sights on the day when you can leave the crap behind it will come make your plans and work toward them i hope this doesnt sound preachy middle and drug abuse school are lousy times for a lot of people including myself believe me when i say that there is life after these times a lot of life

ive had mental depression and severe anxiety mental depression disorder for seven years but ive managed by with antidepressants and therapy the past two years i havent been able to afford therapy but still regularly take my medication i battle with suicidal thoughts every day whether its a good day or a bad some days theyre stronger than others and the past few months those urges have been exacerbated by whats been going on if that makes sense
god your ability to express morosity is stunning you remind me of sylvia plath and youll probably end up hyperactive behavior her youre so damn smart hyperactive behavior her yet you have something she didnt a real connection with people sylvia died before she knew how deeply appreciated her works were i could literally count on my hands te number of times i wished she had a connection with somebody who fueled her kept her going you do you have an entire community cheering for your success why in the fucking world would you give up youre so fucking young god i wish i was that age i would go to school again and instead of doing the major my parents forced me into id major in english ad write and read ad share my thoughts in shakespeare and fittz and scott and blake and taylor etc fuck youre spoiled to think life doesnt offer anything keep your head drug abuse and use that superior knowledge of yours to do something amazing i we every single person youve met before knows you can do itlets go conquer fucking mental depression together message me anything ill even skype talk to you etc until youre nausea of me and the only way you rid of me is by following my sappy trite advice
yeah i was at that point a few months ago its something you cant shake off until you finally wake up one day and decide that youre done being tired what have you triedit seems to me like you should go out and meet new people who appreciate you just because people blame you for things doesnt mean that youre to blame for them you know and you should never feel like a burden or be told that you are its the worst feeling and if someone tells you that youre a burden theyre not someone worth being around
i know the feeling of not wanting to be a burden to your friends i had a rough night myself last night where all i did was talk about hard my life is none of them can relate as none of them have been on the edge none of them know that them trying to tell me what i can look forward too is just an depersonalization pit of darkness i cant say anything to make you feel better i cant tell you its going to be alright i can hope for you and me that it will turn out in the end but i dont know the only thing i can really say is that you are not alone right now i feel hyperactive behavior the only salvation is a head on drug withdrawal syndrome with a freight train but for whatever reason i cannot bring myself to that conclusion youve been struggling with this for number years that feeling of hopelessness hasnt beaten you yet as you have pushed through number years of misery you could take that as a good sign that you have in your heart this hope for things to get better and everything is not lost take away two things from this numberst you are not alone second you have strived this far in your life and have survived where so many have quit wear this hyperactive behavior a badge knowing that you still are here
well i thank god for that battery and i am happy to be talking to youcan you tell me what first made you get into photography what was your first photo that you thought was good

since i dont know what dbt is would you mind explaining it to me a little bit more i am really sorry to hear that someone who is supposed to be helping you is actually really mean to you thats definitely not right and not fair are there people other than that person who you can talk to im honestly not sure why they shunned you and it sounds like you dont know either but im not sure if that would have anything to do with tomorrowyour plan sounds really pain for you just to make sure i understand you have number ish cuts on each arm so number in total im tired concerned for your safety throwaway_lives what symptoms are you having
well i guess it differs between people because im torn heartbroken more depressed mood than i ever was she was the only person i looked forward to seeing every day she was the only reason i still wanted to live
your post title is natural selection i wonder if youre looking at things a bit too logicallyif you want to be totally logical and naturally select yourself out of the pool you wouldnt need to kill yourself you would just not reproduce far safer right however i wonder if you maybe have depression and thats clouding your judgement of what kind of person you are leading you to think negatively sorry to guess dont have much to go onyou said youre not fit for this world but i cant help thinking that you are i wouldnt put many people into that particular category have you been feeling like this for a long timeyou mentioned a person in your post so have at least one in the world im guessing that would be tired upset you also have us although that may not be too much consolationcould you tell us how long youve felt like this and maybe some of the things youre feeling please you dont owe us an explanation of course but it might help to talk things through and we are up for helping if at all possible
i dont know if this helps but i found this site online where you can chat with someone might be worth a shot url the tired least send me a message and ill talk with you

do you have any idea of what made you feel depression in the numberst place

its just that my goals are going to take time and apparently im out of that particular commodity theres no way ill be able to live in my car with my kids and work and pass school all at the same time i already know i cant afford next semester which will set me back and if i do somehow manage to find a place im going to have to be focusing on paying for that and so i wont be able to afford school yet again if will end up on the back burner and ill end up spending the rest of my sad lonely life working my ass off in order to not quite make ends meet
having this type attention till the end really is helping though makes it easier better than listening to sam smith stay with me over and over again
the voice is just a voice people can praise you people can hate you but it doesnt change who you are think about it people can come up to you and say you are awesome but does that change you in any way no it is a psychological thingthink about how absurd it is what you are saying here a little voice is telling you to kill yourself so youre actually going to do itif i went up to a random person and told them to kill themselves they would probably walk away from meyou should persevere you do so by not identifying with it it might always be there negative feelings and thoughts always present themselves to us when we are vulnerable but a voice is just a voice it is not us and we only suffer under its rule when we allow it an earthis happens to everyone it is just a matter of depth suicidal people have invested a lot of energy into i thoughts such as i am worthless i am miserable and you breathe life right into them by doing that and they come back to sap more life let them starveany insult against you is worthless unless you give it credit it is like a cheque that bounces at the bankso dont give into your negative thoughts and feelings stop giving them credit this is hard in the beginning and hard over time but you know you can actually be content and live a decent life if you take this seriously stop giving the i so much credit
you are far stronger then the thoughts of killing yourself death is permanency to a temporary problem posting here proves that youre trying to be strong continue to harness that strength and remember that no many time it rains the sun shines as much
thank you firstly im miserably failing my school year i feel very unintelligent and im under the impression that i wont be able to get ahead in life im ugly ive suffered from anxiety mental depression in sixth grade which lead to an eating disorder and now im disgustingly skinny ive lost a lot of friends this year and i can barely express how fed up i am with life the only thing thats held me back from killing myself to this date is the fear of death itself but if things keep going the way they are i just know i will within a matter of weeks
im so sorry your fiance was such a jerk that mustve pain way too much you cant give up though if you kill yourself youre also killing a baby that could have a wonderful life you could have a wonderful life as well what if you meet a new man what if you make a new friend there are tons of things that could happen to you that you havent even given a second though to but would make your life so much better dont give up i know you can get through this
i hope you didnt do it
i completely understand how you feel ive had moments of happiness but its mostly this dark overwhelming sadness i cant shake i dont know what the answer is i keep hearing medication helps but hyperactive behavior you i did that in my teens and saw no positive changes im trying to just fill my time and see if anything ever changes
thats a tired interesting story ive often thought highly of zen and stoic philosophy but have never spent the time to put them in practiceyouve given me some food for thought at the tired least it might stave off the worst of the depression temporarily
its more you could have everything to live for some people are aggravatingly lucky in life and dont have to work for their dreams to fall in their lap others have to bust their ass and then some and may never find it when someone says life is unfair thats what theyre talking about so youre right telling you you have everything to live for probably wont make a difference if youre not willing to find reasons to live forlately ive been on the fence as to whether being alone is actually a bad thing maybe ive simply been alone so long that its become my hypothermia natural state of being and im just accepting that reality i can tell you though that the only thing in all the world i want is that perfect someone to grow old with its hyperactive behavior the one thing thats forbidden to me like im chained up and its just out of reach there it sits glowing a golden shine i wish i could tell you how exactly i deal with it but the main thing is that i simply dont give a fuck anymore im currently in no position to do jack squat about it and im so pessimistic that ill ever find it even if i can so bleh whatever yes it creeps up on me some days and makes things unpleasant its never been the thing that makes me crying reflex abnormal thoughdepending on what kind of companionship youre looking for and whether or not you have a method of transportation i think for you at least its a matter of finding a place to put yourself where there are lots of people christmas was the first time id ventricular dysfunction left the house in almost a year because i live in the boonies and dont have a car anyway if you have the means then its about finding the ways right all you gotta do now is put yourself around people flex your biceps and wink a bit hope for the best doesnt work out move hyperactive behavior the suave nomad you may be to greener pastures and try therei wish i could tell you where to go and be but i dont know and i dont know what you would hyperactive behavior i do know however that there are groups doing things all over the damn place the hard part is finding them theres moviephiles that see movies together and discuss it latter theres book clubs comedy troupes new job cooking classes dance classes etc yada yada yadain the meantime work on improving yourself sculpt yourself into someone worth being with you proooobably dont have to lots of people would love and accept you for who you are now but its not entirely for them either standing yourself enough to be alone with yourself is something a lot of people never achieve i feel hyperactive behavior its something that should allow you to place yourself on a higher pedestal then people that cant like someone who has attained true independence you dont need constant companionship with any random shmuck you dont even care about im doing a crap job explaining probably what i irritable mood so ill stop there to avoid embarrassing myself further

i didnt want you to refresh your post and see those red words below there doesnt seem to be anything here a bit too ominous a bit too close to the mark when you feel that way ive attempted suicide before and it wasnt unsuccessful by much i know how awful it feels to be depressed i hope that because of my own experience with similar feelings that you will believe me when i tell you that shit isnt as bad as you think its hyperactive behavior a fucking trick or something an illusion even when it sucks you gotta remind yourself of this also remember that random folks you never even met care about you and want you to be alright im not much of a people person but i want you to be alright when other people read this theyll tell you the same thing now heres my answer to your questionyeah call up your folks and yak at them just say mom and dad i feel hyperactive behavior shit its nearing up on being more than i can handle and i just need to tell you that im doing my best or whatever feels right but do itafter that go out being active in pretty much any manner helps much more than you would think make a small adventure go on a walk and make it your mission to find some random free thing that you can put in your apartment if you can take a picture of it and put it here well upvote the crap out of it good luck talk to you soon

my mother had the same attitude she used to be abusive and violent too thing is these people can be quite cowardly in the face of it if you do what you need to do without consulting them they hate it but the more you ignore their demands in light of what you need to be well they will back down they have no choices but you can have them

dont let the rapists take control of what you need to do to fight them they might send around the video anyway if you tell the cops or not but the longer you wait the less the cops can do and the more scared and harder it will be please dont be ashamed someone needs to be punished here so do not let it go go to a trustable person and work with the cops on what to do next
you feel like a fuckup because you flunked a test life never comes down to one academic test though sometimes school can make you feel that way because it is a high pressure environment but you may find that if you step away and try to gain some perspective on your situation there are still a lot of viable options for you this test may have put you in a bad situation but has it put you in a situation where you can no longer be there for your wife and daughter wouldnt it be worth it to live just to be there for them

even if charm and charisma cant ever be learnt or developed why do you have to kill yourself if you are not successful in developing them there are plenty of uncharismatic ppl who arent suicidalyou dont have to ooze charisma or be george clooney to have ppl hyperactive behavior you most ppl do just fine without that if you want to be the life and soul of the party sure a great thing to aspire to to becone that sociable etc but few people are anyway sounds hyperactive behavior you have a big focus on value finding value which is tied up with finding meaning and purpose maybe your challenge is to think about what it is that really motivates you and work to develop sth in that area this doesnt happen overnight btw but you can start today the point of being smart is to use that smartness to develop yourself its what you do with it that counts just hyperactive behavior being born with money if you do nothing useful with it its not that amazing try and work out what drives you and how you can make that useful to others

dt sounds tired interesting economics and maths can be really boring and psychology is great because you get to look into how people work i myself dabble a bit in photography what kind of photography do you prefer and what kind of camera do you use the other subjects you were meant to do seem to fit you a lot better buisness studies does stand out a bit though why did you choose it
you indeed sound tired bipolar bipolar is when you take things to such extremes it is a terrible illness i suffered it myself at one point and have taken lithium and a variety of other medications to deal with it its not so bad it helps but ultimately the problem is a psychological one youre going to have to feel your way around your body and understand your own psychological profile your triggers and so forthwhat is also tired important to note that bipolarity is a two way street you might have these extreme moments of aversion the knife carving incident but what people dont realize is that you also have your moment of desires or what i mean by that is you go way too far into the things you loveif you were just a bit more indifferent about things youd stabilize a great deal i think having had the illness obviously stop taking drugs and stuff like that if youre taking them but also stop staying up so late or doing whatever it is you do to an extreme live a balanced life bonus points if you find that life boring acclimate to that and make it your new norm a stable life is a happy life live a stable life where you are relatively indifferent to most things you will enjoy your accumulated efforts over the years and you will be pleased do not go into extremes of pain and pleasure which is essentially what you are doing leave well enough alone
telling her that it would chest pain you to see her go can backfire theres a risk of adding stress and guilt to all the other painful feelings for some people it can be what they need to keep them from the edge for others it can push them over it you need to know the person well before even having an idea of which one it would be
yeah rejection is a tired hard thing to deal with and i can understand that saying anything to her really makes you feel like youre putting yourself out on a limb whatever happened a long time ago between one of the therapists have you managed to talk about it during a session it sounds really unfair that they would still hold it against youthank you im not there with you so i was naturally concerned thank you for being honest with me about what youve been going through i think that it does take a lot of courage even to post on the internet to talk about suicidal thoughts and selfharm im really glad that you were willing to talk to mei really dont know if words can or will change anything either but i just want to offer you support if you want to stop talking at any time i understand i also want you to know that when we stop talking you can still pm me at any time it might take me a hot minute to get back to you but i will when i can
i felt the same way when i dropped out the first time and i feel the same way now i didnt have roommates i livedstill live with my parents i hate being around people too maybe thats why i hyperactive behavior computers so much that and dogs maybe you could look at url its free all you have to do is make a username its hyperactive behavior free online college courses they have a lot of stuff about computers and computer science maybe youve heard of it i dont think you dont get any actual credit though im planning on taking a python course that starts on oct number i think im going to try to go to sleep i hope we both find some more distractions or better yet something more than just a distraction ill check this later if you want to reply good luck man i hope everything ends up working out for the best
i can understand your feelings very well i have a similar past so i can understand most of feelings hyperactive behavior it wouldve been better if i was not born things wouldnt have turned out hyperactive behavior this at least my siblings wouldnt have sufferedetc i still do have severe mental depression attacks and when they do i want to suicide and put myself out of misery ive been trying to reject my negative thoughtsand sometimes it helps hyperactive behavior i developed interest in music and art i started watching funny anime and all kinds of things i do these whenever im free on the other hand i applied to get admission in a public medical school i failed on my first try though and fell into a dark pit but i gathered my courage n tried again and this time i got admission i stay busy now in studying so now i only get depressed mood when theres a fight or im alone so try finding something that keeps you busy and it interests you itll help a lot
brother killed himself in june dont tell me how much it will pain my family you have no idea
a young person in my small town recently committed suicide i believe they may have felt much the way you do although this person didnt believe it was possible their life meant a great deal to many others parents siblings classmates etc he was convinced nobody cared for him that nobody was there to share his troubles or who could understand how he felt the reality was that many people were there and they did care but that he just didnt see it yet surely there are people at school you might hyperactive behavior to know better but do you always express this openly youre not the only one who doesnt there are kids who think similarly to you who understand you who might be your friend who can help you along growing up is a process of finding these people slowly along the way give things time youll come through message me if youd hyperactive behavior to talk good luck

the thing is with holes theyre a lot scarier then they really are people think that its so high and im surrounded on all sides they loose track of themselves and get caught up and amplify a sitaution that isnt that bad but fact of the matter is theyre simple to get out just gotta go upmy man it seems you need to have a meeting with yourself go out to a place where you can clear your head whether its a hill with a view a coffee shop or even your room with a clipboard forget about everyone else and everything you need to identify your goals and how it is your going to accomplish them no ones more important then yourself i sat down last year and by the time i was done i had number pages of basic to complex things i wanted to do and how to do them when i wake up in the morning now im working to accomplish my goals now i dont want to force anything upon you or give any wrong ideas but thats what worked me make sure at the tired least at the end day you can say while i didnt get much done im one step closer to

i have long since had the sickening realization that id probably enjoy it more if id be better at it than most people but you know whats worse i also know that thats probably not true id still see people who would be better than me and feel crap about thatand yes youre also right that life isnt a competition and neither is a relationship she wouldnt look down on me i know she wouldnt heck she doesnt look down on me nowbut i do i expect myself to be perfect i look down on myself for being hyperactive behavior this i look down upon myself for being so awfully inferior in everything

no one can help without knowing what led you to this point junenumber is right depending on the size of the garage and ventilation and low conumber emission modern car not all garage doors seal air tight you could be waiting a long long time im not trying to be bold by reading peoples thoughts and assuming i can save their life i am sad i know it i built a house there and have an ugly dog that farts poison and makes me ill when i pet it i know sadness i know mental depression its all about human apathy i recognize that youre in a bad way so i sympathizeits more hyperactive behavior being unconscious underwater and having no desire to wake up because you think youll just be shat on more and more but maybe hearing something honest and kind and from the heart of a total stranger might temporarily wake you up and get your head above water even if just temporarily you cant think very well when youre dreaming can you you cant swim for shore if youre drowning at the bottom of a dark ocean you still have to swim yourself to the shore with your own arms and legs muscle breath and effort the analogy is sloppy but the point is everything will be better when you make it to that shore at the least it will give you a better standing point to progress from than gulping fish water some people will constantly be treading water their whole lives with the hope of finding peace happiness and solace but not all i glanced at your post history dont anxiety i didnt go to stalker levels of creepiness with it i havent made little dollies from your hair that i play house with yet you seem to think that you have no reason to be depressed mood yet you are anyway i want to knock the persons teeth out for hinting that something might be wrong with me internally but if your life situation is good yet your mental depression remains wouldnt that be a indicator something might be off i fall into a different category i suppose my life situation is the root of my problems im not a doctor but i do know there are quite a few health problems that can mess things up internally a failinglazy thyroid for example well anyway i dunno how much of this actually matters to you i truly hope things improve for you though if they can for you maybe for me maybe for us hope itty hope hope
hi first of all happy birthday from me and probably everyone who read your messageim sorry youre going through this it sounds really really tough and i hope things improve really soonyour boyfriend would be devastated if you did anything and once the army stuff gets a bit less busy i think you could tell him how you feel once and for all as its tired important that he understands you said he didnt he must be made to if youre posting here the situation is bad enough that he must be made to understandalso i was thinking are there any other army girlfriends in your area i wonder if theres some kind of group they might be a bit more understanding and helpful than the friends you described werefacebook is totally unrealistic people only post good stuff on there so it shows a completely fake onesided lifestyle which is really hard to compare yourself to loads of people have shit lonely birthdays not that its right i spend mine with my wife and kids now that i have them no one else is reliable enough i remember my numberth well youd think it would be with friends nah alone things change though and literally the next year was ok againdo you do any sport they say thats good for depression and it might find you some nicer friends than the ones you mentionednot sure if that helps you will you write back with a few more of your thoughts

good question if it was me suicdal myself if i picked up the weapon of choice id probably call number thats what i tell myself when asking myself when do i call number or go to er ive had suicidal thoughts over the past number years but i never took that first step to picking up the weapon of choice or coming close to the edge of a cliff before i jumped offbut maybe thats the wrong method to use if i need helpif someone else asked me that question then id probably sayonly youknow how far into your sucidal thoughts you are that warrants calling number maybe youve told yourself that youd call number if you started thinking what kind of weapons should i use or i think thats where ill jump or im selecting tomorrow as the day to die or i think ill start giving my stuff away before i diebut like the other poster your thoughts could be one thought too late or you may have a thousand before you take that first step in all cases of sucidal thoughts always find somebody to talk to to air out your mind and get help dont wait

thank you for your thoughts i certainly do enjoy writing or at least used to i find it very difficult to do so anymorei dont feel that my writing has any value and cant realistically imagine breaking into the businessi know the sensible thing to do is to get help i know i need to ring a hotline or ask my gp for a referral to the shrink my mum is actually a psychiatric nurse ironically but i cant bring myself to do it i keep wanting to answer people honestly when they say how are you but i just cant bring myself to do it i always lie and reply im finei have ordered the materials required for my suicide this evening i also have a backup supplier in case my primary source sees through my lies and refuses sale
why should anyone do anything when all they have is blind hope for the future that is the very nature of life yet here we are our ancestors on the plains of africa hundreds of thousands of years ago were driven by blind hope and the urge to survive though most likely only the latter seeing as they wouldnt be able to process such abstract ideas as hope it was hope that kept them running from the lions and pursuing ways to prolong their lives all we have as humans is hope by taking your life you not only kill your hope but the hope that your parents have for the life you will leadbut life is much more than being happy and unhappy by taking your life you guarantee that you will be nothing ever again that you will both cease to feel the ache and the good that you have forgotten i know you have felt joy but your mind is clouded by your despair as a human being you are privileged with a great many things as a human living in the united states you are privileged with even more suicide may seem hyperactive behavior a glorious end but it is an end you will never appreciate life is filled with suffering ive lost a best friend to cancer another to war ive lost family members to car accidents and disease i have known my fair share of suffering along with the turmoils that plague my mind but life is about finding meaning through suffering nihilism is correct when it says that life has no intrinsic meaning but that does not irritable mood that we cannot give it meaning suffering is a means to finding the meaning in our lives and your suffering is no differentyour life has meaning and you have near infinite potential life has just begun for you plus none of the shit youre dealing with actually matters high school is the most bullshit filled period of our lives and has absolutely no bearing on who we become the key is simply to survive it and as you know thats the hardest partargue with me all you want but at least listen to what i have to say
i am honestly not sure what the ae is or what their procedure might be but that sounds really frustrating to me i can understand why you feel like they dont want to help you it sounds like youre exhaustion from getting the runaround by ae and stuff like that i can hear that youre in pain and exhaustion so much that you want to kill yourself but you said that theres a part of you that still wants to be helped i can definitely see that part of you its the part of you that led you to post here and talk to the people on this thread and while i cant guarantee that they wont notice your wounds i think that youve already waited months to get the appointment just showing up would be giving that part of you that wants to live a chance i am still tired concerned about your safety especially since you said that some of your wounds are infected would you mind talking to me about your plan a bit more and the wounds
i dont deserve to feel better i am a failure of a person and i deserve to die my life is ruined and theres nothing left for me now the things around me cant be happening i dont recognize the things around me or myself as real everything feels fake and nothing feels true i dont want to have feelings anymore
i get what you are saying and i get how it makes sense but rejection is a pretty recurring theme in my life its hard to see it as anything but a big sign saying fuck you any more

i agree with both of you in different ways although depression is not something that you can simply tell yourself to get over you do have responsibilities outside of it maybe spending time with your son will even help cheer you up i dont know but you cant forget about him he hasnt forgotten about you
i cannot say i have been in your shoes however i have felt immense ache as you have i have had the hours days months filled with agony and feeling despair and hopelessness ive lost a good near everything i ever once had or loved its devastating sometimes i feel as though ive lost my entire identity consumed with selfloathing and hatred i too suffer from body dysmorphic disorder in my turn i suffered from extreme bulimia down to number kg at number and it was along with the lingering effects awfuli had to start living for in what my eyes was success expanding my knowledge on the world around me enveloping myself in global affairs anything to take my mind off my ache i became encompassed in a world that didnt involve me distraction was my obvious getaway this may be not for you i never liked it to even be brought up but i began to seek some form of spiritual journey i tried to set some good into this world bulimia nervosa my soul for a higher thinking i took on philosophy and metaphysics find reasoning behind my suffering this is just my escape i hope that youll find some relief from my advice im sorry for your experience and give you my sincerest best wishes
the new therapist seemed pretty ok but it was only my introductory session i may look into buddhist teachings more seriously im not really a religious person but i feel every religion has a pretty ok secular morals side to it im going to start running again i think i miss being in even slightly ok shape i lost a lot of weight recently but thats just because my appetite has been terrible i figure if i stick to just drinking water though i can start eating properly again and keep some of the weight off
ive read your other posts so i know you mean well but i wish youd stop saying thinking is bad if anything the chief cause of suicide is our poorly run responsibilitydenying moneyworshipping society that fails to prepare us all for life period for myself thinking is a way of analyzing what i am so that i can direct my life its from confronting my internal behaviour and decisionmaking processes that i reason i can and should do something with my life at all or maybe even i will only ever make decisions based on my longterm experience of wanting to have a function in society i have to know thisthank you for yet another thoughtful and insightful post im appreciating them

get to a doctor quick tehtossed and as you said maybe this psychology centre isnt the place for youim not gonna tell you all the stuff about people who love you etc you need to know that depression is a mental illness and there are medicines that can treat itthe problem is you may not know youre sick the world seems hopeless and grey and suicide seems like the only solution depression is a dangerous disease and the reason its so dangerous is that its invisibleuse the drive you feel lately and get yourself to a doctor one that is willing to do what it takes to cure you you need the right combination of medication and perhaps some cognitive therapygood luck
you were told that you were intelligent and kind you also mentioned that people wished to be like you in my opinion this is one of the sweetest compliments ever these are the qualities that people most admire about you and who knows those qualities that you dont see might be what people use to encourage themselves to improveyou dont feel good looking but girls see something in you appearances arent going to last forever girls notice that youre kind and intelligent to me you seem like a guy who is honest yet critical of himself and if that is your most worrisome imperfection then you are already a great person by principleim glad to hear that you have some days when youll accept yourself and its no surprise that there will be bad days there will be horrible days too but there will also be great days i know because ive been through it too you will learn to adapt to the changes graduallyi used to be better at handling loneliness because i was never truly close to someone so when i first met someone i was truly close with i felt like i had been waiting forever to meet him we made promises to be there for each other to me promises are always kept especially in relationships and close friendships when he left i learned something the first person who leaves you after a promise wont be the last person to leave you people come and go this is a fact you just gotta keep going because eventually someone who has been through what youve been through will stay and i think that is worth all that youve been through it is worth believingim just like you its so hard for me to open up but six months later im learning that its okay to open up sometimes i just cant even if i try but i just have to remind myself that itll be worth it i get that youre trying and all im doing is trying too because if we dont try well get nowhere i get youand dont worry about rambling ahh dont apologize im glad you made it through today i feel grateful to have met you and talked to you actually we can talk more if youd like c
talking it out was a good choice i am happy you made this choice i agree though that sometimes things seem too good to be true and so you are comparing them to your past life which rekindles how you used to feel these feelings will come and go in your life unfortunately but just look at your success and your potential and you wont let the downward slope bring you all the way down the mountain
i wish i could feel some hope i lost my companion pug last week and all hope is gone
id second this try another shrink psychiatrist drugprescriber or psychologist talktherapy there are good ones and there are bad ones and there are lousy ones and awful ones and ones who quite frankly ought to be taken out back and shot shop around if you can until you find someone who makes you feel better if they dont then theyre not the right shrink for you no shrink can help all patients and no patient can be helped by all shrinks nature of the beast
you have nothing to be sorry for just hang in there
thats how it was with me before i pretty much gave up i seemed to be doing alright but then i kept getting worse and its like the depression just took over i was surprised my boyfriend even came into my life its funny how no one in my school payed attention to me but someone halfway across the world did im sorry to hear that you lost people who were close to you i definitely know that feeling all of my friends pretty much abandoned me so all i really have is my boyfriend i believe my mother would be hurt maybe my sister i grew up in a pretty messed up home so other than that i doubt my father or brother would care
its time for me to go earlier than i expected but i there is no point living through this shit anymore i dont expect ever to be found or remembered even before i go i may turn back and released that im a fucking idiot but thats unlikely thank you for your help even it was for a day
there was probably more to your relationship than drinking having sex and watching tv but these are the things people enjoy about being in a relationship and they seem tired special and romantic but everyone wants to drink and have sex and watch tv those are the only things anyone wants so you should be capable of finding another person like that
see thats not helpful for anyone involved here the fact that people are reading what youre writing and replying is evidence that theyre wanting to help and for what its worth i really dont want you to die nor do i want you to feel lonely on valentines or any other day for that matter

the good thing about life is you can always start over i watched number grams the other night it really changed my perspective on life because i have existential issues of my own link here url said you fucked up recently to me that sounds like different areas of life went wrong for you at the same time maybe theyve been long coming and it seems so much to deal with at once having support can completely turn that around i dont manage my living situation directly but i help towards it forms and bills that would overwhelm me are dealt with easily i have people to talk to because they are professional staff and its possible to move on from there to full independence one step at a timeyou might consider all the things you can do all the experiences you havent had yet write a bucket listcan you share specificsi really think you should carefully consider all the options you have

i know how tall you are but im quite short and went from number to number in number months i didnt even do that much exercise and i certainly didnt starve myself plus im older so by metabolism is easy slower of course were entirely different people but before you make any big decisions consider that there are achievable goals that dont take such a long time to attain and they might make you feel better about yourselfi firmly believe that everyone has the right to end their life but i also think its something that needs to be rationally considered please dont think im condescending but at number you have plenty of opportunities to make changes in your life that will make it seem less bleak
im here for you as well and im more than willing to listen to you feel free to message menumber you arent alone dont give up
for what i read your friends seem to be acting kinda childish it shouldnt be that big of a deal nor should affect your friendship in such a way id tell you to count your blessings more than your losses you have a great girl and the opportunity to find a better place that suits your needs if they arent willing to accept that moving out is not some kinda of betrayal then it doesnt seem to be a real friendship you know at least from their point of view i understand your feelings towards them might be sincere but friendships cant be onesided try to work things out but all in all its up to them to see that they are making a huge dramafest out of something thats not that bad
thank you again
my mother committed suicide earlier this year largely due to money problems as someone who has had to cope with that loss all i can say to you is dont do it people often say that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and i feel like in the case of debt and things of that sort this is especially true look dealing with this stuff isnt going to be terribly fun or easy but im sure you can find some way to figure it out and i bet there are plenty of people who would much rather support you through this stuff than have to deal with you not being around anymore just stay positive and put in as much effort as you can and im sure things will work out
what do you hyperactive behavior
the depression that ive had for number years its only getting worse
just hang out with my boyfriend go out to dinner watch tv drink wine whatever my life is not at all unpleasant the problem is im just not able to give a shit about any of it
please dont feel guilty you have a disease and it is so strong that even your partners love cant seem to stop it its not your fault and its not an unusual thing to happen maybe its really for the best if you outsource the job of taking care of you that could take the feeling of guilt off your shoulders and also relieve your partner of some of his responsibility you have two great things working for you at the moment the fact that amazingly human beings care for each other unconditionally and are even able to forgive the worstseeming things plus the will to live that you expressed in your last paragraph its there its true cling to these things with all the strength you still have thats all you have to do the other things are out of reach at the moment you can care about them once you feel better get well soon
not exactly recently it is rather the conclusion of a life full of depression loneliness being hurt
calling number was the correct answer and im glad so many people told you to bit of advice though she will probably be anger at you for this but do not let it bring you down realize you did the best thing you could ever do for her and she will see that sooner or later also the comments she is making towards you is to get your attention to see if you care or is an actual threat so you definitely had reason to suspect both you made the right call good job
are things going any better today

have you considered a certificatefoundation course at a university i know auckland aut victoria uni in wellington waikato university and canterbury all do them they provide a pathway into a specific degree after i was rejected at aut i did one for six months then was allowed into the computer and information science degree if youre set on uni this might help you find your way and six months on top of a number year degree isnt a huge ask if you need any more help looking into this or just want to chat to another kiwi feel free to pm me as the government will either give or lend you money while you study this could be an excellent opportunity to get away from your family some space to become your own person not in relation to them may help also youre not a screw up most people dont know what they want to do with their lives at numbernumber and dont have it figured out from my experience number of people i went to high school with have changed hugely since leaving school there is no guarantee your life will be the way your parents have made you think it is you have a chance to make a life you like and youve taken the first steps by identifying your problems and asking for help uni isnt the only way to go either if youd rather work consider applying for internshipsjobs which will give you some training i know new zealand couriers do a great one working straight out of school doesnt mean you wont go to uni eventually either earning some money first and getting out of a difficult environment is a pretty smart bet
i am sorry youre going through this your friends boyfriend doesnt seem to be the best person if hes forcing her to cut ties with her friends or he wont be with her that seems really manipulative have you tried talking to her about it i would hate for you to lose a friend like thati understand the kind of release cutting can do for a person whenever i cut i always feel really overwhelmed right before but the pain and sight of blood is cathartic but only for a moment because then i realize what ive done i realize that the wound will take weeksmonths to heal and after that therell be a nasty scar that ill have to worry about hiding you are entitled to feel how youre feeling its an extremely stressful situation however you said you stopped cutting because you believed there was more to life hold on to that ive read that when you feel the urge to cut if you draw on your skin with markers it produces a calming affect for those who need pain to ground themselves drawing on themselves with pens work a little bit betteryou said that youve been happy for awhile and that youve made great friends perhaps reaching out to them during this time of feeling unhappy would be beneficial

if she can drop you that easily despite what youve had all you can do is forget her and move on what good is obsessing over her even if she came back she could go again at the drop of a hat fucking you up even further your best choice is to shut her out of your life completely and deal with being aloneits difficult when on the rebound what you want is to be stable which means not starting another relationship re this one stand your ground now that youve been betrayed as a form of selfrespect if nothing else you have to respect yourself above others you have to be harsh on yourself at times to make the pain less in the long run being comfortable with being alone is better before being a relationship then you arent so distraught when someone goes and you have other coping methodsrelationships are never perfect the first time wed love them to be but the secret is you have to be prepared to be open with every person you get involved with to learn more about yourself and whats really healthy for you eventually you find someone in theory that meets expectations but why should it be easy how could it be easythis isnt the end of the world you in fact have every single option that was ever possible at this point you can distract yourself with something positive something rewarding you can find friends and even a partner again in time but accept the reality this is over any deep bond of trust has been broken the best thing you can do for your future self is pick up the pieces sooner rather than later alcoholdrugs wont help

the risk with taking toxic levels of acetaminophen tylenol is that theres a tired good chance it wont kill you immediately but it will completely fuck up your liver and make whats left of your life extremely pain and utterly miserable unless youre a masochist i would rethink this weekends plans im not even trying to talk you out of suicide here im warning you against trying to get a taste of death using this method i can actually relate to a lot of your post i used to use drugs and booze all the time to try to hit that sweet spot between existence and nonexistencehow old are you sunny

theres a big difference between going for a drive with the intention of going off a bridge and actively actually turning that steering wheel to do it every day for a month i drove the same highway to work and every day there were three checkpoints where i could drive off a bridge as you put it but i couldnt the actual will to end my life was not there and it was the worst my mental depression got knowing i couldnt end my life even if i wanted towhat changed over the years were a multitude of things but the answer that works for me is the one that you describe in your own post no one cares the moment you stop caring about other people and its obvious to me you care very much the more you can care about yourself if you want to suntan naked then be damned all the people who stare and judge if you want to eat your face off then be damned all the whispers and murmurs being an respiratory distress syndrome adult human is relatively simple its autonomy in the day to day of your life and having the final say in any decision about yourself you cant control other people but you can control yourself the control over yourself you can try to exert is finding things that dont make you hate yourself and repeating those actions instead of the ones that dofinally ill address your last point head onyou dont care you never have cared you never will care youre absolutely right i dont know you ive never known you and i never will know you the same is true about patrick in the uk franz in germany or anne in texas you cant bleed your heart about each of the numbernumber people a day who die only those who you care about immediate to you beyond that what we do what im doing is just throwing my two cents into the bucket and maybe somebody will find it shiny enough to take with them
hey man i know its rough when school is such a focal point of todays society im a senior myself and i find myself teetering over the edge on the grade scale too no one ever said itll be easy but thats why theres people like usyou see people like us are the game changers weve been on both ends of the spectrum and know its ins and outs were the ones that make an impact regardless of how large we build our lives into something were proud of by doing so inspiring others to follow i know work and money and school all seems pointless but were only numbernumber done with our lives i know it sucks not being able to do what you want i went through the same phase of computer now work not your parents are really looking out for your best interest trust them on this one and lifes just one of those things where youre going to get back what you put into it the more you do the more you give the better the turnout you wont know exactly what youll get till down the line but if youre confident in the moment then what goes around comes aroundi took after another redditor and printed this offurl give it a year and see what happens make the best of each day tldr trust your parents build your life into something your proud of and remember that when you apply yourself anything is possible cheesy yes but i learned in the past year theres a truth to this
i saw the words thich nhat hanh and it was familiar with me if you know of ajahn chahn one of the quotes that really resonated with me isthere is nothing in this world that does anything to anyone nothing worth crying over nothing worth laughing nothing is either inherently tragic or delightfulwhich i am trying to live by things are only sad or bad if we perceive them that way everything is inherently empty until we fill them up with whatever meaning we give them i am tired much trying to think this way and keep this mentality although it is hard i believe if i keep trying ill get closer to getting better at itwhat you said about the hungarian woman going back to her family and what you said about love i do believe thats what love entitles you to owe to it no one reads the terms and agreement sheet for love lol they just sign it at the bottom not knowing that pain is part of it thank you again for just taking your time to message me and help me through this i think its normal to feel what im feeling but at the same time i wish my love for her was morepure maybe thats not a good word authenticselfless i wish my love wasnt founded on jealousy and insecurities because i know it is

i was in a similar situation at your age life will get better but will also get worse its just part of growing up youre so young now you have a full life ahead of you no matter what happens between your parents being in a similar situation your parents might lash out at each other and carry the anger towards yourself ignore it as they dont really irritable mood it or if you have to call the authorities stay strong kid

you need to see someone to start a new and helpful cycle is there anyone that can make the appointment for you or come along with you
its hard to explain i can talk and make chitchat i can fake social enthusiasm if need be and i can talk about a wide range of topics but i lack the ability to really connect with people somehow either i cant keep conversations going or they lose interest and gradually decrease contact with me it also doesnt help im awkward as hell generally quiet and seem to shut down when im socialising in a groupperhaps partly because ive grown up so socially isolated i just cant fit in anywhere and have so little to contribute to potential friendships and i think people can pick up on that so theyll be polite and talk to me but its all superficial with no intention on their part to include me as part of their social circleive learnt and developed automatic social responses so i seem far more welladjusted in public than i actually am all it takes is a fiveminute conversation with me to discover that its a sham and theres actually nothing behind the curtain but smoke and mirrors
sorry was exhaustion yesterday and had to go to bed its pretty cool you managed to send a few applications
youre really hurting right now and im sad to hear it noone should have to endure that much pain from chronic illness or mental anguish let alone both at the same time youve made some tired specific claims there what evidence is there that your so would be better off with someone else has he given any indication of this

the darkness can be a haven death isnt the answer though i know how you feel and i can tell you this death is the better choice but why you ask look at life right now what do you think or picture where will you be next week month a year number years from now you cant tell right niether can i i assume myself to be dead but i dont see it doing it myself not until i know whatever reason im still on this godforsaken planet has been completed and i can die peacefully you may not see it now but you have a reason for being here we all do whether good or badyou may think death is what you want but the reality is you will find it sooner or later but doing it now will only stop you from achieving your purpose here im damn near homeless no job no car in debt broke and you know what i wake up everyday smiling ready to face death in the face because im here and im not leaving until whatever reason im here has shown me the exit door and you shouldnt go creating one for yourself whatever death may bring you may not hyperactive behavior what it holds if you decided to piss off whatever it is that may be expecting you or planned for you next i dont believe in heaven or hell but i do believe that everything has a cycle and breaking it will only cause more ache eternally whatever choice you make though i hope you find peace friend call me abnormal behavior but i believe everyone including the ones hyperactive behavior us with hopeless lives deserve a choice whether it be life or death
this is exactly how i feel right nowi have just accepted that i will never be happy for more than a week
hiya a lot of what you said almost mirrors perfectly with myself hell im even the same age spookyi have a real problem personally with leaving my comfort zone and placing myself into new situations hell its called a comfort zone for a reason its hard to hate or think something that makes you feel safe and alright it actually harmful theres even that one saying about how life begins when you leave your comfort zone but i dont i could say hey guy all you gotta do is break the tedium up by putting yourself out there bla bla bla but i know from experience thats easier said than done i also know from actual experience from trying a few times havent gone all that great sometimes i think were victims of the times that adapt slower to changes everyone seems so distanced anymore my parents use to go out ever day maybe go to the bowling alley with their mates and get drunk and have fun go to the river and unwind with good company even just driving up and down main street people seemed closer back then now it seems most of us sit and stare at a screen anymore to talk to people sad in a wayim afraid i dont know what to say to help you because i currently havent figured out myself if your life has become tedious then find something you might love to do to break up the tedium as far as the pointlessness of life goes thats just life it starts out pointless for everyone life is about finding that points during the journey its just that the way modern society works can stand in the way and hinder that pursuit if you dont know how to circumvent ithave you considered ever sharing your insights with others there was an article on crackedcom written by a guy that was homeless for number months he was more a couch surfer than a shelter person i read the comments section after reading it and it was an eye opening read for a lot of people that will never in all their time see that side of the tracks i felt it provided exposure to the difficulties of life that more people really need to be aware of instead of being close minded and judgingdamning people below them anyway its just a suggestion maybe not the best one ever i know that site is always looking for new writers and works with you to get your article ready to go live they even pay you no idea how much i wouldnt imagine a lot try to be more optimistic about relationships there are so many people that the odds some even find traits you feel are negative are actually attractive qualities to them yea i know people are weirdos whatever floats their boats i guess i also think people that have persevered through hard times are stronger individuals overall compared to those that coast through life on golden sails youve actually had to put effort in youve done things that were harder than anything theyll ever experience thats something to take pride inwell i wish you the best you can break up the tedium in time but finding the point of your life is something youll have to discover yourself its a new year and a fresh clean slate number numbernumbernumber numberxnumber number jackpot i have no idea what im doing now
its kinda impossible to run the numbers as you cant predict the future something could happen tomorrow that will improve your life immeasurably im pro choice but i suspect many people that consider suicide arent being rational
im doing somewhat better i got caught up in thinking about all my problems that day and really just needed to get everything out that made me feel better its good that youre doing the same im working to get myself back on track academically you said you dropped out but are you interested in going back to school please dont think that thats not an option because it didnt work out for you the first time if its something that youre interested in doing it just might give you the feeling that you have a future and something to stick around forim not saying you should definitely go back to school but it is one good option you can get help so that youre in the right mindset to do the work work out your financial situation and go study something that you love it sounds to me like that might give you the sense of purpose that you dont have right nowif you think going back to school isnt for you what else can you see yourself doing lets just assume for a moment that you decide to stay what kind of job would you like to be doing
do you get out in nature much or have a chance to have a garden or hunt or fish
i dont want to have to go to a mental health hospital or something i dont want any of that it would absolutely ruin my school careerjust to address what seems to be your main concern again i dont want to have to go to a mental health hospital or something i dont want any of that it would absolutely ruin my school careeryou most likely cannot be held against your will at a mental hospital and even if so it would be perhaps for a few days secondly your school legally will not need to know this information and is not allowed to make any decisions based on it even if they do find out i know it might seem that people might be angry or ashamed or disappointed in you but in reality they just want whats best for you and right now that means getting good care firstly good medical care because this is urgent and then you can decide what to do with your mental health from there all these decisions are yours
listenim not saying i can fully understand what youre going through and if your mind is made up theres nothing i can say but please dont go through with this im here im here im here im here and im asking you not to do it you are valuable your life is valuable you are worth living you can always change your life for the better and you deserve happiness dont let anyone including yourself tell you otherwise
depends doesnt it depends on from which point of view you look at it you get around and go to new places use that find friends there talk to people it all depends on your attitude the mind is a powerful thing
you dont know that all you know is that you are not happy at the momentgo to the doctors i irritable mood itmonday first thing you do you have no idea but you can be happy it takes a bit of time and work but damnit just do it
i googled something hyperactive behavior this what came up said theres no easy way to kill yourself its gonna be messy there is no easy way to this youre gonna feel ache and your mom will be devastated and still have to clean you up for your funeral you dont want that it sounds hyperactive behavior you care about her its not okay to make her come facetoface with the idea that she failed as a mothertheres no easy way to it its gonna be messy

it doesnt matter what demons others hide they know my demonsi can remember every little terrible thing that has happened and i cant help but feel like a runt i feel like i have no soulim sure there might be some people that care but they cant save me its only a matter of time before they leave me
i came over and tried to look at her phone she hyperactive behavior jumped on me and said yo give it back i said she was cheating she said i never agreed we were back together so in a sense yes
you are welcome i know it sucks but you really didnt do anything that would make them act like that be sure you are not the problem here they are hopefully theyll understand that at some point
im thinking youre grossly underestimating your potential my friend if you have friends now you can make some more you just have to look in the right places you say that you wont be able to make any friends that arent as socially awkward as you but why would you want to be friends with people who cant relate to you there is a lot more to sociality than being popular trust me i can count my friends on one hand and theyre all just hyperactive behavior me nerdy average looking and fit with a desire to change the world you want to be around people who are hyperactive behavior you because the people who are hyperactive behavior you hyperactive behavior youthis world is filled with people certainly youre compatible with one of them fuck it find one on rsuicidewatchrsuicidewatch as long as you dont go all romeo and juliet on us but demeanor is key the only thing that youre suffering from is poor perspective i know how real it feels how hopeless you can get when you feel down but theres a way outim curious what is triggering these fitsalso whats your motivation for going into premed
will do lets hope this works kind of out of options
cool thats goodfriends can be ridiculously unreliable honestly even when they have the best intentions i know you want and maybe need them but most people cant give back whats required sometimes its just human nature they wont always be fully tuned in with you unless they know that they annoyed you they probably have no ideatry to take it easy at school see if you can relax a bit and try not to worry easy for me to say isnt it but i think it will help maybe you are overthinking things
look below for answer to question second paragraph everyone gets in a tough spot sometime in their life at some point most people feel hyperactive behavior living is a great burden some fix it on their own others need help and as clichxcnumberxanumber it may sound dont kill yourself or try to get murdered or anything hyperactive behavior it you can move on from this relationship and find someone who truly loves youthe real reason to why suicide isnt any good option youre unique no one will ever be or has been truly hyperactive behavior you society cant replace you to every problem theres a solution some solutions are more difficult to achieve than others change is constant emotions people memories etc they all change over time change occurs more or less to everybody lastly remember that there is always someone who cares enough to want to help even though it may not seem hyperactive behavior it these people are hard to findthere are a lot of more reasons but you get the idea hope you find this useful and hopeful
yeah i know how awful it was to feel hyperactive behavior that and i just wish someone had have told me how to fix it not that i can tell you the exact way to fix your situation but you will never feel fully better until you talk everthing out and even if she isnt willing to talk to you write her a message or a letter anything that lets you express all of your feelings literally everything so you can feel at ease with the fact that you did everything on your part to gain that closure you will feel better i hope everything works out for you
wow youve been through a really shitty ride i cant even begin to imagine how you feel after having your ex get your hopes up like that only to be crushed again and reaching rockbottom nor can i imagine what its like to carry around the ghosts of the awful things that were done to you when you were a child it also seems like you were terribly let down by psychiatric treatment you really tried to get help but it didnt work its never like the zoloft ads in real life i wonder since youre already committed to ending it whether you wouldnt try just one more experiment before you do if the experiment fails you can end it all the same nothing changes but if it works then you just might find happiness the experiment im talking about is looking at what best tailored plan might be able to help you to feel the way you deserve to not miserable just one last shot to see if maybe just maybe the right people might be able to pull you out of this godawful pit
pm me and lets get a conversation going you can tell me about your hobbies favorite books movies music etc i know the feeling man i get this way to because i am often just shuffled aside and no one really talks to me
maybe you should try opening up to him more you guys are in the same sort of boat just for different reasons real dialogue with a friend could be helpful but youve got to take the steps to bring it to the level you need i guess what im saying is dont settle for comfort words would you have rather someone have found you i find that when im down or suicidal i crave an intervention but dont go looking for it
id rather be manic forever than go through another week of this fucking low
it sounds hyperactive behavior you were talked into college and not a general want to go as for your father the situation is sticky he may not realize it or you for that matter that his unwilling to live is not helping you succeed and become the person you and him want you to be its showing you to quit but do not as for your mother i can only ask you talk to her that is only if she is one to listen and not lash out now that youre number it may be best to look at finding a stable job and just moving out the environment is very bad for your current life feelings
im proud of you
just pray i dont go to hell they say if you commit suicide you to straight to hell its the only reason why i havent this far im just so social fear to go to hell
ive been suicidal for the past number days and i understand the immediacy of the pain id recommend contacing a suicide hotline for to help with coping with the next few days and contact as many services as you can on dealing with debt there must be a way even if its by declaring bankruptcy and and starting over with nothing debt wiped clean im working under the assumption that if the ongoing and immediate issue of the debt was resolved then the pain would be managable even if it was on a day to day basis as i do there must a service that could help or a way to resolve the issue and so you should do whatever it takes to make it through the next few days until you can see an end to the debt being there after that things would be definitely manageable i hope that this has been of some help even if it was just to have someone who can empathise with your pain hear your story
we all live for those of us around us if we were alone on this planet there would be no reason to have any ambitions we all keep each other sane and happy to one degree or another despite going through tough times thats why life is worth it
its not dumb it happens do you feel sad and depressed mood or do you just have fantasies
i would imagine a lot of people here have been depressed mood or suicidal and i know they and i would be happy to talk and relate
i failed out of chiropractic school number months before starting my clinical rotations another year and id have been done everyone i was in school with is now graduated and practicing and you know what i actually enjoy my current job far far better than any chiropractor i know they make more money than i do but i love what i do and its a path i never would have taken had i not failed out of schoolif you failed out of school then there was something fundamental that didnt fit with you either you arent ready or it isnt something you need to be doing right now focus on opening yourself up to something new and go kick some ass
im so glad you did that be kind to yourself and try not to worry too much about what to say i hope you mentioned in the text how urgent it is and i truly hope it goes okay and that everyone is understanding youre hurting in more ways than one and just need and deserve love right now
id recommend contacting a suicide hotline they would probably know best about how to get physical help above all being in pain and any psycosis is in no way your fault and so suicide shouldnt be how things end ive been suicidal for the past number days and though my experiences have stemmed more from depression and pseudopsychotic issues im open to help as much as i can above all please contact a suicide hotline they would most likely be able to give the best advice on how to get physical help
that sounds crappy im sorry you had such a shit day i hope that lets up soon the worst thing is when it drones on for seemingly forever in my experience the good days get there eventually i hope they get there for you too im afraid im not very good with words or with cheering people up im just another sad soul on the internet all i can do is offer my sympathies and youve got all my sympathy i hope youre able to hang in there
ill answer the question in its order i do worry but a lot less than i used to it can be rnadom thought at times but probably tied to the worries i constantly had as for relivingnumber was molested as a kid forced oral both ways with number year old male babysitter and my younger brother he was also forcednumber was fingered by my older brothers friend in the pool number i get a lot of attention from men because of my body and makes me paranoidnumber one ex bf wanted to have sex and i said no many times at that time i was also extremely suicial i gave up the fight because i didnt care i also lied to myself that maybe ill finally have romantic feelings for him i never felt lust or love for him but enjoyed his friendship you could say hes friendzoneable but dated because i rather be with a nice guy than with someone who could abuse me later i felt pain that he would be so persistent and not listen to what i wanted i ended the relationship because of that it was a dark period of suicidal thoughts when i realized i had actually allowed it to happenand now my current bf i wonder if i actually want him or not i definitely feel some lust hes cute and i love everything about him but i wonder if im just mentally raping myself because i dont want sex i ignore the no in my head because i wanna do itim ashamed to not let him know that i actually dont want sex for a long while at least until marriage but i gave myself over to sex for the fun of it even though im not mentally all in if that makes any sense i def need to let him know but hes gonna be torn up about it thus i dont want to pain him or anyone as i said i have a tendency to pain people
no youre not you think youre done but things change every single day maybe not in a way you can notice but they do and when things change they will change the way you feel there are a million things you still have to experience and i do not know you but i believe you would enjoy experiencing them
im just another being on this humble plane but id like to offer what advise i might have so here goes it may not get better at school school is not the only place there is dont give up after trying one path there are more and they are more different than you would believe life could probably get a lot better in your next stop i bet youd be seriously motivated to succeed if you changed paths death is of course not what you really really want wouldnt you like to try something exciting before passing on how about this there are people on reddit who would talk to you every day personally do you think that might help support you
what do you do to cope
that is fucking shitty to have your father be in pain and not find help do you think that perhaps time will heal his woundsthere is certainly a lot of pain in the world things can really suck i feel for you seeing a father in trouble is really fucking shitty there is just something about a father that means he shouldnt be in trouble fuck man my dad has ms and there is really no proccesing it
hey depression and suicidal thoughts are not correlated with how great your life is going there is no shame in mental illness regardless of how many wins you can rack up its okay to be sick when my boyfriend committed suicide a lot of people said things like but he had a good family and he had you what kind of guy would give that away it just doesnt work like that of course acute situations can push someone to committing suicide and that is what i would worry aboutim not sure what your financial situation is but seeing a professional is the best thing i can recommend not just once but consistently youre not alone people feel like this all the time its not to minimize how much pain your in but to empower you to know that there are people who recover people who grab ahold of all the things you wish you could feel it sounds like selfesteem plays a big role in how you feel calling yourself a pussy not feeling comfortable around women etc i can assure you that being in a relationship isnt the key to getting over it and people who say to get over it should be kicked in the shins anyways i read this i see it im thinking about you there is someone out in this great big world who cares about you and wants the best for you okay
i do come in contact with people at work all the time some of my team members are there with me others are communicated over the phone as they live far away my boss gets emailed constantly from coworkers about how well i do my job its always positive feedback from everyone i work withyet it really doesnt invoke any feeling i still feel like i am a fuckup that cant get anything done right and i feel completely alone im in management a team lead basically but i feel like the lone wolf all the time its hard for me to really engage in small talk with them i dont even know where to begin with that so i just stay professional and emotionless in my communication as thats easiest for mei go out sometimes bars clubs etc i try to talk to people engage in conversation with them men women it doesnt matter i just want some form of connection the conversation seems like it goes well they are willing to give me their number we text maybe once or twice to each other then they never respond back hell i had a girl grab my phone put her number in it then dialed her cell from mine a few days ago i text her back about two days later telling her we had a good time she agreed yes she said she wanted to meet up i said sure how about thursday i never get a response somehow i fucked that up once it gets to that phase i dont know why or how but its something i did that disconnect always happens all the timethen again how can i expect anyone to like me when i dont even like myselfgranted the therapist cant tell my ex anything about me what i am afraid of is if i start opening up and then the therapist decides that i am a danger or an unsuitable dad or some nonsense then calls someone like social services or whatever then my ex would know about it and pursue it because shes mad i got more custody than she does the therapist didnt break the law my ex did exactly what i would expect her to do and i am the one that suffers for it
please dont
your problems arent smaller or bigger than anyones they are your worst experiences and you are entitled to feel any way you do however many people need help with feelings that arise from those experiences also professional therapist might help you to figure out what you want to do with your feelings towards your sexi wouldnt think about those scars im number and mine are number years old and propably will be visible always i feel self concious about them but i dont think they affect how people treat me
everyone deserves to be happy its hard to see it but im sure you are not a bad person depression clouds your judgment and your vision ive been in a similar situation just recently you live for that person and then you are called clingy because that person is the only thing that makes you happy so you plan your day around them and that aparently is a bad thing trust me if hes playing you around like that hes not worth ityou have to try and find things you enjoy doing take your mind off of these thoughts keep yourself occupiedif you ever need to talk feel free to pm me
short term if you want to avoid some severe gastrointestinal discomfort you might want to take some probiotics youve got to be really careful if you plan to swallow a bunch of random pills like that you might end up taking something that doesnt have the required effect but does leave you in a mess physically im thinking organ damage etcdid you fall asleep with the expectation that you wouldnt wake up how did you feel when realised it hadnt worked
this so much emphasis is put on treating the chemical symptoms without looking in to the actual psychological causes
i am always willing to talk i also suffer from depression and just had my med changed feel free to reach out to me
well as a girl i dont really know where you can meet girls but i can tell you i did meet my boyfriend online and not in a dating site either just social network just got a message from a random stranger and we started talking about random things i find it to be a good way of meeting people it can go one of number ways you can find people that lie or people that will be absolutely honest because they have nothing to prove to youi know being alone can be tough and in your case having someone so close to you that you want but seems so unreachable at the same time i dont think you can go out looking for love but just put yourself out there and it eventually finds you sometimes it takes a while of course but when it comes it will be worth iti know i probably didnt help much just wanted to tell you not to give up love just has a way of appearing when you least expect it
wow you are just hyperactive behavior me i irritable mood seriously i felt as if those words were typed by my hand my hand from years ago growing up i didnt had much access to technology hyperactive behavior i do now so i really would have downloaded an app but i did set a date hey would you guess what was the date exactly a year ago well a year and number days to be exacttalk to me you say theres nothing to fix and it really is scary how much you sound hyperactive behavior me but theres pleeenty of room for growth you can always better yourself you dont have to tell me how much time is ventricular dysfunction left on the timer if you dont want to but please do say why do you want to die what was the shit that went down
have you considered going to an aa meeting there are plenty of resources that you could attend that would help you there are also plenty of people in your same situation try going to a meeting sometime and just listen for the first couple meetings then if you get comfortable you could try expressing yourself and letting out your emotions the key is not to find short term happiness but to be happier in general i wish you the best of luck
im planning on going to school for bartending but i cant afford to pay for the schooling
this is awesome
documental as in journalistic also do you share your photos with anyone number film cameras is a lot why so many are they all tired differentwhat happened for your father to be dissapointed in you it seems really harsh what he did do you see him often do you live with him and his number model girlfriends
please get help you dont have to go through this alone it can get better
you guys bring tears to my eyes the fact that a complete stranger goes out of their way to help me i cant take it im so grateful for you people you are the ones who really make a difference i wish i could just give everyone whatever it is they needed so that they could be happy i am hopelessly hopeful but i respect you all a lot i debated joining the marine corps and for reasons i couldnt join but i guess if i become this doctor i could still be that person i want to be right im so bad with words these days everything was so much easier when i was a kid
this situation is all too common do you find your friends not as interested as they have more of a phobia social life and just less time to socialize and are drifting away due to differences in life styles im not going to argue for or against the statement that life is meaningless i once thought these same things its hard to grasp just how much not being there would crush the world around you whether or not you believe me there are those who care but just dont have words to share with you if you really want to make life less meaningless find something that helps one person a day in a positive way if you find yourself making others happy you may find a way yourself to sit down at the end of the day and feel good about yourself from there it is your own journey
far too many people in this world are naive i dont really know what else to tell you except than trying to find new friends that will care about you i hope you dont try to commit suicide again however you never know what opportunities life might offer in the future
im actually in therapy now though im lax about taking my antidepressants at some point i just figured i wasnt worth the expenditure and the effortpeople who have worth have others who see that worth all i ever am is a friend or a fuckbuddy never worth anything more not a good daughter to my mother not as someone to love and cherish to anyone i open up to people with worth are recognized as having worth and worth is assigned by outside forces the most beautiful diamond in the world has no worth if no one wants it
sometimes all one can do is be captain obvious but i hope you know my intention is to let you know that im here to try help but i also know that platitudes or empty words arent any help at all
the trouble with suicide is that it is so bloody final just because you have tried hard to get better and it hasnt been sucessful yet doesnt irritable mood that you will never feel better what a shame it would be if you killed yourself now and a cure for your problems would have presented itself in the near futureyou say that you have a history of mental illness so ill assume that you regularly see a doctor have you tried discussing your suicidal feelings with him or her
i love you too and yeah there are definitely still depressed mood parts of life but thats to be expected i think once you find something or someone that youre really into you might realize that the good can be worth the bad thanks for posting here
when were things bad and judging by your statements things have gotten slightly better
the first one really hits home for me i feel hyperactive behavior i died a year ago and this body is just whats left still trying to pick up the pieces since my diagnosis
hi following you to this post ive been thinking about you since the last time believe it or not i was wondering how things are going as i didnt feel all that helpful on the last post so im glad i found this oneafter some time passing youre posting again so im seeing that youre feeling down and im really sorry to see that i still think there is hope for you and there can be a positive outcome i have faith in you although we have this limited interaction through a website which makes it a bit trickythis subreddit is by its nature about a drastic action of last resort youve posted twice and are now saying it needs to happen soon obviously i dont want that to happen does what i want mean anything well maybe not right now or ever all the same i want to get through to you and try to help and for me what happens to you does matter what i would like for you to do is find a way out other than the planned way youve been analysing the situation but i believe that your judgement right now may only be at say number due to depression bad circumstances clouding it etc my own assessment of my life is often wrong too depression can be a chemical thing and its hard to assess when you have it your feelings at least some of them may be difficult to assess due to chemicals im not saying its just chemicals youve got things going on and i realise that but i ask you openly and as best i can to find a different solutionso i want you to try a couple of things i cant make you but evidence that i care is that im writing this and checked up number months later on what youre up to so in return i ask for just a couple of thoughts and actions you dont really owe me this but you owe yourself this for certain number think about people in your life family that things arent screwed up with and make contact to see what happens its tired rare that there would be absolutely no one possible i suppose but superrare i would expect when people commit suicide there are people left behind that care im sure in numbernumber of cases i will be one at least other people posting here reading this the police the photographer their families tons of people that you may not expect number see if you can make a massive changeway out other than suicide like maybe something that would seem crazy like hitchhiking across your country then going to another one or two visiting africa honestly the biggest change you can think of doing charity work or something a number change as youve already worked out that things as they are are not what is working out for you you cant fail if the other option was suicidewhat do you think
im lost for words by how tragic that story is but please dont go please dont go so you can tell me and others the story of how wonderful your girlfriend and your friends were please dont go because this incredible indescribable pain that youre feeling will begin to heal with time please dont go because you can add value to the world especially to the lives of people who like you have been through so much pain youre busy going through the worst of it the agony is raw youre still bleeding out on the floor reeling from the loss please let people comfort you give it a few weeks then you can make a more informed choice theres nothing to lose in waiting right
i feel the same i dropped out of school and ended up taking classes online my life is meaningless and depersonalization and void and im at the point where i dont even want to make anything from it anymore i just want to die guess i just wanted to tell you that youre not alone
you sound hyperactive behavior an incredibly smart eloquent young man who has the potential to do a lot of really amazing things both for himself and in the world which is where you need to spend more time i know its tempting to do nothing but hypersomnia and stay away from people and do nothing you should avoid doing this if your thoughts are scaring you you need to be doing things that give you a feeling of control over the situation and that take you out of your head ultimately if you want to completely change the situation and take control of it tell your parents if they disown you they disown you if they dont they dont but youre taking away the great unknown immaterial punishment waiting to come drug withdrawal syndrome down tell them about your grades about how its affecting you and take it from there as a side note my brother aced drug abuse school and college and i was the drop out today i have an incredibly succesful fairly prestigious carreer life has honestly just only begun for you and you have no idea where its going to take you buy the ticket take the ride as someone smarter than me once said
i wish you both all the best please take care
thank you for opening up here it must have been really hard to put something so signficant into words above all annas death shouldnt mean yours as well and youre in no way a murderer no one should have to go through what you both went through anna may have had great potential but what about your potential is there a single kind of life that you think that you could still leada suicide hotline would be able to really offer some advice on how to cope with losing your family and with the everything else please try contacting one before trying anything you shouldnt do anything because you feel guilt towards mellie you did nothing wrong
what you do us entirely your right in my view but i suspect your emotions are a bit raw right now so if i were you i would be making any big decisions for a whileand if your kids are having to deal with the divorce i really doubt they would view your suicide as a blessing in fact probably now more than ever they need you you may have to accept the marriage is over but your relationship with your kids need not be
it really is hyperactive behavior that isnt itloneliness never leaves even bringing it up incites mockery i was thinking earlier today about how ive wanted to die more or less for over a decade i keep telling myself it will get better or there is always some other thing to try but that appears to be nothing more than a lie a carrot on a stick to string me along from day to day people in solitary confinement eventually go insane i feel hyperactive behavior i need to kill myself before my sad mood consumes whatever small bits of human are ventricular dysfunction left in mewhen i had friends i remember that happening im in my late numbers now so most everyone i know knew is in relationships or getting married i havent been touched in almost a decade i cant even bring up how much that hurts without abnormal dreams mockery it does chest pain though it hurts so much i want to cut myself something i havent done since i was a teen but what else am i supposed to do i have to let these feelings out somehow meditation cant cure the need for human contact i guess its my fault it has to be i just dont get what is broken about me or what i did wrong in a past life to be so inherently offensive as to not be worth touching am i made of poison am i poison i wonder that sometimes i must be its scary what other people wont tell you about yourself that they clearly seei just dont get it and no amount of personal change or venting will change it i dont get it i guess i am broken and do deserve it death appears to be a slow journey i understand why those statistics ramp up as you get a bit older you forget the lies you told yourself to make it each day
youre welcome to talk to me i dont have a degree but i know a bit on the subject and ive been to therapy what helped was talking about myself i never stayed in long enough for analysis plus im free

it helped me a lot to think about my grandparents because my grandfather died a year before my birth and he invested a lot in my future even though he didnt now ill be born a year after same for my grandma she wouldnt live longer if id have commited suicide and maybe my parents too i just couldnt do that knowing that i would destroy my very small family
sorry to hear about that i still think that going outside away from other people could be really helpful
hey man you cant be convinced and i cannot change your mind okay i am going to tell you not to do this for a completely different reason than you would think i mean consider it if you die it is nothing to me right you are just words on a screen not really but i hope you understand how i mean this really i have no vested interest in your survival however i am interested in saving you from pain i dont like pain never been much of a fan theres too much pain in the world already to inflict it on ourselves physically effexor is not the drug you want to od on trust me i am no doctor or scientist but i have read the literature on how it works and have had some firsthand experience the first thing you need to understand when making this decision is that you may end up in a hospital you may end up in a great deal of pain while you lie helpless in a hospital bed waiting to die but you may not even know what is happening other than an experience of complete terror and regret the second thing is even if somebody catches you in time and you survive you may have lasting damage meaning you will still feel this way but even worse because of the damage youve inflicted on your body that is not even considering the embarrassment and other emotional upset shit you will have to face from the reactions of those close to you treating you it wouldnt be intentional but people are people and someone nearly dying is pretty scary if you havent thought this far ahead about it or considered what would happen if you failed you are not ready to make a decision like this that is it oh also it will likely be an extremely uncomfortable thing even if you succeed just give it a bit more thought dude this isnt the way you want to go out or the decision you want to look back on and hate yourself even more for
im so sorry you are going trough this firstly even though you might know this its not your fault and you did everything you could do at the time secondly do you have anyone that might help you irl sometimes even people you think wont help might be able to do something
not for you there wouldnt be but for those you ventricular dysfunction left behind is another story the ache and sadness theyd have would cripple them
all of what you are describing are short term problems talk to me i would love to help you where you want me to
im not sure if thats what you perceive as a risk and if it is i dont understand which part of it you see as riskythe risk is that im sectioned and my family find out thats probably a little dramatic but i honestly dont know what my rights are if he believes im serious plus i dont think i want to be talkedmedicated out of it at the moment fwiw im already on medication this isnt a chemical imbalance issue
its a she she doesnt seem to get that im reaching out for help she has been through it so by all counts she should understand better than most but no
whoever youre seeing will steer the conversation you dont really have to worry about it the most important thing is to be honest with them and make sure you find someone who you feel comfortable with
a small farm and a large family seems like such a wonderful life goal i hope you dont give up
i appreciate this so much this is the first time i ever post or tell anyone my feelings ever i understand people have a worse life than me and im very thankful to at least have a roof under my head but life sucks at points and i needed to post my feelings somewhere that no one i know in real life would find out i have a big heart i dont think i can push myself to ever do a bad thing to my father even if he did it to me
i figured eminem totally gave it away hahaim weird i like deep house but how good is guns n roses do you play any instruments
i know that this is kind of silly but my favorite app game i like to play is number you mentioned that you like strategy so i think that you might like it im too addicted to that game do you find that those distractions help youyou know at the beginning of the conversation i heard that you were in a lot of pain im just wondering how are you feeling now
i was expecting you to follow up on that title ive found writing helps to get all my thoughts out so i can make more sense of them i can write and think literally all day im analytical everythings difficult to get down in my writing because each thought leads to something else its like i want to paint the big picture but i can never do it all in so little words as people want me to i always go offtopic dont take that as a bad thing when it happens to you thoughmy strategy is to deal with things before i can feel bad about them should do it going to do it will do it okay im going to do it it validates logically too it gets me in the frame of mind for dealing with it because i create a response rather than waiting to deal with it then again it varies with context i just dont do phone calls period if i can avoid iti stumbled into a homeless shelter about number years ago and im still here depression and with my head down all the time tired worried and generally debilitated i wouldnt have occurred to me to write about my problem here or to phone any support line id shared a house and got increasingly worse anxiety because id dropped out of uni and then couldnt pay my rent share for most of the time for about a year and a half i would respond with a yes or no to staff here but i recovered i made real progress eventually even though i still isolate and spend all day online and dont want to have anything to do with real people apart from occasional interaction i was in a constant fearanxiety of people in particular a knock on a door or a bellbuzzer would set me off throughout school i hadnt sought mental health help i was mostly silent introverted reflective ultimately it stems from my early family life and feelings of abandonment an emotional upset shellanyway some thoughtsnumber dont feel bad for not writing in the same structure as everyone elsenumber consider your loved ones might be frustrated and not sure what else to do not ablenumber depression can be a symptom of underlying selfesteem body image problemsnumber have you tried blogging to get your thoughts out or email drafts or somethingnumber its okay to be a bad friend its okay not to live up to expectationslife isnt logical but we can say of the world its far too complex to say we dont deserve a place here from there we can work towards the specific problems we face and improve either our perception of the situation or how we respond to it changing it ideally a counselor will spend the time to go through the specifics but theres plenty of stories about bad counselors
well its good that accomplishing schoolwork makes you happy what i usually do when ive got some things to do but dont feel motivated to do it is that i do the easiest and quickest ones first this way when i feel like giving up i look at the things ive accomplished and get reenergized even though they were easy tasks after getting the easy ones done i watch a funny video or post then start doing the harder ones while listening to my playlist im not sure if itll work for you too but its what i do it might help
dude your daughters life will not be better without you i want to make that clear that is seriously the most true thing ive ever said in my life leave your so if things arent working out you will get partial custody of your daughter and she will grow up knowing her dad you are not defined by a job and getting fired from a job is something everyone goes through youll find a new job and youll get back on your feet what are you up to currently
im sorry to hear about socks passing away i know that animals are different but i am glad to hear that you love your cat and she loves your cat too it sound like youve been going through so many emotions i am concerned about your safety when you are feeling lonely are there things that you try to do to keep your mind off of these things
as for my friends this just happened to day i just texted someone and they where hyperactive behavior dont worry youre making a big deal of something that isnt so i take it as they didnt take too much offence to it but it still makes me look insecure they havent clearly said we dont want to talk to you but it might end up to the point where im not wanted around because of the way ive actedas for my ex shes just been ignoring me she told me off then ignored me she doesnt want to talk to me she hasnt talked to me in number months ive been contacting her once a week
hey anxiety sucks what do you enjoy doing
if i dont have an easy means to achieve them then it makes life harder i havent been able to enjoy myself like the great outdoors in years only my company gives me something of a pleasure but its fleeting i come home to no one
its not the end it just feels that way or at least it doesnt have to be you have an entire lifetime to fix these things and while i personally have never bought into the idea that what doesnt kill you makes you stronger i do believe that you dont have to let it define you another life is possible i promise
with pills it really is a try until it works i was put on celexa worked fine for a bit and then i started cutting then my dr put me on a trial med and it worked but was so expensive that i did my research and found something similar that had a generic while you may not have the money to seek professional help does your school offer counseling services to students if so start with them just explain that you want to talk and see what they have to sayyou are a good person dont let your parents bring your mood down you got this you are strong i am here to help any way that i can because i know what it is like to not have someone to talk to
met her my sophomore year fell right in love she never had an interest until this year but then she had to move drank a bottle of whiskey in one long chug tried to shoot myself but got too drunk to remember why i was drinking went to a psych ward i went to visit her and we hooked up decided we wanted to get married have kids the whole deal but she lives number hours away and its very easy for her to cheat shes a documented sociopath and never feels bad i found a train schedule for my town number pm tomorrow itll pass through
dude you got skype im in the same position as you i build computers too edit tried to end it last thursday im always free to talk life is worth it
its hard to do this over the internet rather than in person but im going to try anywaytheres nothing that anyone could write in less than reallylargebook form that would get you from where you are to where you want to be thats the joy of the human mind its big incredibly complex contains trillions of interconnecting ideas and therefore there is no quick way to change it the place where you are now and tell me if im talking crap is one where you are trying to filter through and understand all that information and all of the feelings youve had for years and then predict not only whats going to happen if you choose any one of a number of options but also whether the possible conclusion to the attempted clairvoyance will then be what makes you happyor to put it another way youre trying to understand your entire brain every thought experience and emotion and predict multiple futures and then predict your entire brain in those multiple futures its very ambitious and most people would never think that big but might i suggest something a little less taxing to begin with at least i want you to make a list of things that you enjoy not things that you should enjoy or things that sound good or things that were cool back when you were number and you think you should try taking up again things that actually give you pleasure even the smallest amount right now as long as theres one item on the list then thats fine doesnt have to be anything significant at one point in my life the list consisted ofa i hyperactive behavior the first drag of a cigaretteb i hyperactive behavior to drink cold waterthis is the starting point for figuring out what makes you happy now and so therefore what you might be able to go and do that would make you feel happier right now from here you can move on to other ideas that might make you happy now but youre not sure possibly because theyre a bit scary too hyperactive behavior going to a bar and chatting someone up and then perhaps things that you know will make you happy but in a couple of days ordering a couple of really nice cigars online might be my examplelike i said this is a long process if you hyperactive behavior you can write back here or privately you can perhaps find someone professional or at least with some training to help you along with this process or you can simply take it from here yourself entirely your callgood luck
i have been in your shoes the best thing that i was able to find were places that offer sliding fees even some places dont charge at all if you are truly in that kind of a rut i was able to find some online sites of community groups that have depression and a therapist emails you cant remember the name of it but i will try to find it for you if you are interested
i dont believe anyone reading through suicidewatch is completely happy and are you number
i got a good doctor when i was in hospital for the first time and he talked me to try again i tried number different kind of doses and medicines and last fall it finally clicked i need number different kind of meds at the same time to be able to work on myself in therapy or function but biggest thing for me was thatnumber years ago i got possibility to start therapy and i found a person with whom i can work in therapy its really important to find right therapist it seems to be more about personal chemistry than which dicipline the therapist uses and then i went talked about the hardest things and let her in more i told about my thoughts more easier it came for her to understand where my biggest problems lay little by little i got better for number years i hardly saw change in me i was frustrated and jealous i felt that i was failing in my attempts to get better but this year things started to click i saw myself more clearly and that made my work easier i still go once a asthenia for number hours i have bunch of disorders apart from my depression but i can manage them easier but no depression
i am also number and have experienced the same feelings although i reject medication and i have never had a good psychologist or psychiatrist you are not wrong to feel the way that you do but you might want to reevaluate what the core reasons are for why you do feel that way such examples would be were you abused as a child did something traumatic happen to you or is it just your brain chemistry reaching the root of the issue will help first offi would highly suggest learning more about spirituality it has helped me tremendously develop your own understanding of life and the universe as a whole start out with learning about philosophy then science then maybe learn a bit about metaphysics watch something like the new cosmos series its beautifully fascinating and it will leave you inspired you will probably find that yoga and meditation will help quite a bit also listen to calming music to assist you when you start off learning about these things if you have trouble with meditating see if there is a sensory depravation chamber spa in the area and set up an appointment if you continue to stay curious and wanting to gain as much knowledge as you can in this life i believe that will distract you quite a bit from being depressed that is what keeps me going at least
i went through a period in my life where i wanted to commit suicide and my close friend who had actually just made an attempt on her life a few weeks prior said this to mewhat ever it is that youre going through what youre feeling it is not going to be the thing that you die from you will look back on this and wonder why you were ever worried you can do it dont let something you arent sure about be the reason you leave your friends and family behind
i can understand that you would rather take your own life than die from drugs society is fucked up and i hate having to conform what right and normal to society sorry if i come off as annoying i just know there are better and more options than just choosing death you just have to find them
fuck other peoples idea of pathetic you have a right to live you also have a right to be pissed off im serious you dont owe humanity anything nobody asked you if you wanted to be born mother teresa wasnt well known for her employment killing yourself doesnt solve the problem move to uruguay and live off the grid
hello do you have reasons for thinking like this did anything happen that makes you think like this do you want to talk about it the community and i will be here for you
have you tried joining your local gay community groups there are likely tons of opportunities for friendships and relationships as well as feeling a whole lot better about yourself you wont need to hide and you wont need to feel hyperactive behavior an outcast consider it
i know everyone says this but it truly does get better everyone has hard times in their life and they build character we truely wouldnt be living without hardships i wish you the best of luck and if you want you can pm me number
you know i used to be like one of those people who thought that people who wanted to commit suicide were stupid or cowardly that changed when i got severely depression a few years ago getting depression was a concept alien to my family and generally everyone i know so i never told them that time i felt like i just wanted to stop the feeling but realized i just couldnt kill myself i wanted to live thats when i realized that i was never going to call people who want to commit suicide coward or stupid ever again i guess what im saying is i want you to live too
i understand what you are saying but i dont think that even if i were strong enough that it would be worth fighting anymore i have given myself until christmas its not a localized rash generalised decision i need time to think about it
your friends may not have the capacity yet to understand what youre going through also if you told them casually they may have passed it off as a crying reflex abnormal for attention or as a joke i remember kids saying stuff hyperactive behavior this all the time in middle school if we get a shit load of homework again to night from mrs___ im gonna kill myself as for your doctor a doc cant turn you away hyperactive behavior that if youre suicidal its crucial that you tell him everything and make yourself clear when you tell him what youre feeling i know its hard at first to open up but thats what hes there for hes a professional and is only there to help you also was a parentguardian in the room at the time if so you could try asking them to step out of the room for a moment while you speak to the doctor privately if you feel uncomfortable with them around thats totally okay too
i appreciate the time youve taken to write all that out it seems that bars and sports clubs aside you favour simply initiating conversations with random people until it becomes habitual hoping for the best that some of these random encounters with bear fruitif i cant make friends with the people i see and talk to nearly every day at work what makes you think random people i have no connection at all with will be better i have to say no one ive ever spoken to makes a habit of starting conversations with complete strangers even at bars they generally stick to people they already know or friends of friends so they have something to break the ice with and youre asking me a socially inept defective subhuman to be able to have those kinds of conversations with strangers that most people cant or dont want to do that requires social skills and nerve well above that of the average person to do welllike i said i do appreciate your response and i respect the time it took to write it im afraid theres just something fundamentally wrong with my wiring im not able to just converse and make friends i never have and never willalso my method is guaranteed to work number success rate and doesnt involve any of the actions you listed so dont worry about that
could you join a support group im not sure where you live so i dont know the resources you have i found talking to people in similar situations really helped i would try looking into a psychologist sometimes a change in therapist is good have you asked for help i know that seems like a silly question and if that came across negatively i am so sorry i just know that for me asking for help was the hardest part once i did i found that so many people wanted to help me concerning the license could you get a bike even an old crapper from the thrift store is a start exercising will also stimulate those good endorphins and hopefully have you feeling better i feel ya on the job front times are tough and your situation is tougher go into every business and put in applications once you have a job its easier to find a better one the social interactions with your colleagues can also help you feel less isolated try not to let your fear of acceptance deter you i like to listen to i am what i am from la cage aux follies when im feeling bad about myself back on the subject all that i have said above will help you escape the prison of your mind i can see how moving to a more enlightened area will help you the reality is that for now at least youre stuck where you are so work on escaping from those negative thoughts if someone knocks you down figuratively get back up because we both know that a you dont deserve that treatment and b they are full of shit you are a good person worthy of love i have a mental method my psychologist taught me to build myself up would you like to give it a try i really hope my words helped you
so what do you like college isnt for everyone but there might be a trade etc that is right up your alley if you are having issues talk to a health professional as well they can hook you up with resources that are free that can help with coping methods etc
i am depressed mood with or without alcohol basically i know alcohol is no solution not a short term and not a long term but i just cant ignore my still strong first day feelings for her and the alcohol takes them away completely the numbermm i dont know i play video games but i dont even know how to handle a gun i just bought it as a option first but this option is more and more thr option people i talked with also said that this is life and time will pass and and and but the thing we all can agree on is that everyone is different and i happen to be a person who just cant handle loss because of past events and i just want her back otherwise this was it

genital mutilation is fucked up some people might try and make you feel like shit about this but i agree with you circumcision is generally fucking horrific and im appalled we still do it theyre your fucking genitals and you have to live with them nobody has a right to force unnecessary surgeries on you before you can even have an opinion me personally when i learned later in life about what issues people have as a result of circumcision i was really fucking upset and depression about it the problems are wide spread and most people arent aware of what they have missed because they know nothing different like i personally hate my penis but it still bugs me that this was done to me without my consent as well the loss of sensation is scary anyways i love you ophappy april numberst number
i cant really tell you anything to help you cope with loneliness even at my darkest i never felt lonely although i was very much alone it was a narcissistic thing i isolated my self from others and used it as an excuse to justify me not being able to connect properly with people or form meaningful relationships thats out of my league but about the failure part i feel you being a unaccomplished person can be hard and the more you fail the harder it gets i still feel hyperactive behavior shit when i fail even at little things its sort of a thing that had carried on from the past what worked for me is a small change of mindset even the smallest of victories enjoy them take baby steps the sun is falling and im still clean today i got up a little earlier i didnt crying reflex abnormal today it sounds kinda silly and even a little sad but it really helps you know the accomplishments really do attention deficit disorder up even if you feel hyperactive behavior its pointless when you fail again maybe youll even get to this part its a quote from another redditor it was from a thread asking what small feat they were proud of someone saidevery fucking little thing i dodamn that was an amazing omelette i rockshit im good at tying my shoelacesfuck i only hit snooze twice today i must be some kind of deityit made me smile you know thats a fantastic mindset i cant really feel that happy or exited about the little things i honestly try you know it works when i feel hyperactive behavior complete shit on my way home from work i straight my back and remember myself of how fucking awesome i am and even if you know its a lie do it lie to you self believe that lie it will slowly make you a better a person and then it wont be a lie anymore my personal is to be hyperactive behavior that guy tho hahadamn must be niceanother thing that helps is having a clear goal when i feel hyperactive behavior im a total disappointment i sort of day dream about my future have an impossible dream one so large and distant even uttering it will come up as a joke but its no joke every single step no matter how small you take is progress be happy to have made it that is the most important thing that saved me actually i wont really talk about my dream its the most personal thing about me i dont feel ready to share it but my other two goals are to become fucking awesome at the guitar and learning number fucking languages ahh it do feels better thinking about it you know im a complete disaster at either of them im self learning both no classes or teacher or anything im just a failure at guitar it took me months to learn a single song and not even a hard one but hey i learned it i fucking learned it yeah and the languages fuck they are so hard but baby steps you know ill take them i know one more word today i accomplished something i think its the daydreaming that helps the most it really makes you want to reach those goals i have the stupidest grin when i think about the day im a some random place and there is a foreigner and the dont speak the local language i talk to them in their own language to perfection and then someone comes to me and says wow you know german and i goyeah i know german and french and dutch and portuguese and russian and japanese and korean and spanish and italian and goals man they do that to do they make you look forward to the future even if you are a loser one day even one faaar in the distance one day you will have something a real accomplishment it may be a diploma a studio album international fame what ever the point is that its yours
i have another meditation being able to quiet the voices and tune out of all the relentless bullshit media inputs is amazing its hard though and needs constant practice i got quite good at it but sadly ive slacked off and as is often the case depression kinda kills the motivation
as much as i dont want to advise the breakup it may be the better option as you state hes not adding to your well being from what you say some people dont know how to deal with these situations or they just dont understand it on a different note what are you going to school for
go to your neighbours tell them you feel incredibly nausea and need an ambulance
you say you want to be appreciated well you pointing out that without you your family business would probably go belly up that is something special right there as for your family perhaps you should try getting closer to them and attempt to become comfortable with opening up to them family is important i didnt want to open up to my mom about wishing i were dead either but then i talked about it and the sense of relief i felt from it was a reason to live in of itself just start having out with your family and get closer to them that may help with the loneliness as for the partner situation keep your head up and be yourself although worrying about the partnership situation after you handle the depression period dont put your faith and hope into a person just because theyre your partner and you want to be with someone we all want love but we need to learn to love ourselves and love life first before we can work on finding someone to spend your life with
maybe you are just gifted not sure if you are but just make sure you absolutely know yourself before you kill yourself because there are likely many unknown unknowns about yourself which if you do figure them out may give you something to work with i had been diagnosed with some shit too but medicine didnt seem to work i asked myself why came to the conclusion that the nature of medicine is to alter x dopamine levels for example to a state in which it is healthy but if x was healthy in the first place then it could be that your problems are caused by something y unknown to you you even said maybe im looking for somebody to change my mind to give me that eureka moment since nothing before has worked the eureka moment should not only be the above but also the understanding of the significance that you were looking for one in the first place numberth of january fuck that that is far too less time to figure shit out therapists are generally dumbasses whose knowledge does not extend beyond to what some course told them to know
what is the problem seriously tell me everything
both but prefer to smoke by myself ive always kinda been a loner and just love it that way
it sounds like you need to find someone who you feel comfortable letting your guard down and sharing your emotions with it can be hard keeping everything bottled up and putting on a front to make it seem like everything is ok if you can be honest with yourself and some others about your issues then i think it will be a really freeing feeling and it will be a lot easier for the healing process to begin therapy and suicide hotlines are both good places to start since it can be difficult to make yourself vulnerable to friends and family but instead of letting these emotions fester inside of you i think you need to share them with someone
hey whats the problem feel hyperactive behavior talking about it
i am only a bit older than you and oh its maybe not useful or comforting but you have my support rarely is a day where i dont suffer from thoughts of selfharm i hope your days get steadily better i really do best of luck to youedit hobbies that really keeps me going i hope improving a skill will make things brighter for you too
i would hyperactive behavior to thank you all for your supportive comments i recently read an advisory commenturl that has been rather insightful in combination with your help and this sage wisdom i may not be fully clear of my suicidal ideation but i do feel more confident in seeking helpthanks again
the question is is it too late to change the trajectory considering how much time ive spent on it it all feels so overwhelmingly difficult both impossible and pointless i dont think its something i can manage on my own even doing all the courses in the worldyoull have to forgive me i can feel the onset of the depression hitting me again and its making it harder to do anything by the minute
yea im here messaging two people at the moment il talk to you what you wanna talk about
still here if you need anything me others have you spoken to anyone else about this
i can say that everything is gonna be alright and you can be strong enough to survive this but i have never even in the slightest been depressed mood or drug abuse to any drug at all so i cant really start to imagine what you have been through these past number years what i do know that it wasnt only because of the phone that rang you stopped yourself to commit suicide a part of you as you said wants to live and i believe if you can find the strength in that you can overcome this no matter how bad the odds are nbsphowever the first step when it comes to things hyperactive behavior this is that you have to be brave you need to tell your family that you dont want to live but you are trying your best your family can help you and they will be there for you because in the end you are a part of them nbspnow if you have old friends thats doing drugs aswell or even selling to you you need to stop having any sort of contact with them it needs to stop its hard i know some friends can be people who has always been at your side but you need to let gonbspif you feel hyperactive behavior doing more talk just pm me
way more people are killed by dogs than rattlesnakes every year where do you live your best species for death would be a mojave green or a timber rattler but it will be incredibly painful and there is a good chance you will live especially if you are bit on the hand or foot as opposed to the neck
oh man i know that feeling staring at the pills wondering if i should take them all whenever i get like that i try to get out and do something the walk must have been nice its been raining here all asthenia kinda peaceful to listen to though
i am so sorry you are so sad and wanting to write a suicide note i was where you are at not too long ago
are you in immediate danger whats bothering you it might be that theyre really swamped with phone calls some people need the help while others dont need it that much youre not alone do you have friends or family you can call
the only reason i havent commit suicide up until this day is because of my parents despite my hardship in life they always loved me number years they loved me despite all the mistakes i made and i couldnt bring my self to suicide and make them sad i just live my life and tried my best to overcome all this depression
could be you didnt study the right way things change through college so dont give up i thought i wouldnt make it after i resigned from nursing school but then i changed majors and now i am on my last year
youre right people dont suddenly become friends it takes time and common interests if you volunteer at an animal shelter or a zoo or a museum you already have at least one common interest with the others that are working and volunteering there given enough time if you keep talking to the same individuals its possible for you to become friends with someonemy grandmother has been living in assisted living and still manages to make new friends just by seeing and talking to the same people everyday youre never too old to make new friends
im in the same boat im having a hard time finding a job and im stuck with my parents theres always hope though have you considered volunteering anywhere hyperactive behavior an animal shelter becoming a volunteer is almost guaranteed and it is a great way to meet people
im glad somethings positive is happening for you and that youre enjoying a hobbyi stopped the hobby thing when i realised whatever i did would be a hollow substitute for what i actually wanted out of life and what little pleasure i had from it was outweighed by the sheer amount of time and often money it would take to become investedsocially i have no one to confide in theres one person who i supported when her bipolar got really bad and later helped get her through funnily enough a suicide crisis of her own so i can sort of talk to her but were not that close and she has little time to do anything with me considering shes married with kids my family are out as theyre not the kind of people i can talk to about this kind of thinglong story short i have no one i can really lean on
on a side note i would take my mother to the grave with me if i could its just too much effort and i would feel way too sorry for my dad shes a really nice person wellrounded and loving to everyone but i have this irrational burning hatred for her and i want her to be as dead as i want to bedoes anyone have any idea why this isjust for clarity i wouldnt ever kill her
hey im sorry to hear you feel like thatim not going to tell you that you shouldnt because people love you or that theres a reason to anything at allyou dont choose to be born sure but you along with anyone else on this earth have the ability to do anything they want it may not be easy it may not be fun but i could pack up my car take out my cash and leave tomorrow nobody can tell me otherwise and thats the beauty of it save prison theres basically nowhere physical or otherwise you cant escape fromim not saying go on a road trip but you will find a journey that you feel is worth making
im illness of life yesterday i again got into what i call the suicide preparation mode this generally lasts for almost a month where i make up my mind well enough to attempt suicide plan everything meticulously and take the plunge this time i wont fail theres no way i can fail by jumping off a high rise
im sure you hear this all the time but where you go to college doesnt define you people brag about where they went to college in effort to validate their own insecurities it makes people feel good knowing that they can number people even if that number is meaningless in the grand scale of lifehigh school is a terrible time for a lot of people i know that it definitely was for me believe it or not it does get better college is different than hs and the working world is even more different than college just give it a chance i was in the exact same position as you at your age and my life got better yours can too youve only lived a small fraction of your life and while things seem hopeless at this time just remember that life is constantly changing
i am typing this with a somewhat severe headache im not sad nor am i glad i dont care about anything ultimately everything is pointless we live on a grain of sand in the middle of an enormous beach i would prefer to have never been born and yet i dont really want to kill myself at this point in my life i could have had been surrounded by friends i could have had a girlfriend i am attractive and intelligent i value rational thought and the ability to question everything and so what am i doing here scrolling up and down this subredditbefore i go on ill go ahead and tell you that i am currently number close to number years old though im hoping that your response will be insightful as opposed to the usual youre a teenager and you have teenage problems talk to someone who gets paid to listen to you and your problems will go away if they dont take medsso why have i not surrounded myself with friends well its because i am not blissfully ignorant these people they talk about the same things every single day they crack the same jokes every time they see fit to cut it short i feel as if they are proof against the concept of free will because they dont appear to have a mind of their own they are easily affected by commercials they are easily manipulated and to think that i used to be just like thatobviously i shouldnt befriend people who i dont like i shouldnt enter a relationship with a moron just because shes cute the problem is that its tired difficult for me to find another person with a similiar mindset i want to meet someone who can think of something that i have not already thought about someone who can say something that makes me want to call this person a genius my life appears to be hopeless i have skipped countless days of school sure i could work towards high degrees but i fail to see a reason when i have lost interest in life in general i highly doubt that ill ever find another person to care about i have been staring aimlessly around my room for a while now and my head is pounding im not sure where to go from here my only real way of entertainment is gaming and even that is limited due to shitty economy i spend my days on the internet watching youtube videos listening to podcasts reading webcomics being on reddit i really dont understand why i so rarely break out in tears ill stop typing now perhaps ill submit a post of my own im not expecting anything is there a remedy for my apathy
i kinda have hope but its just depleting im getting the results of a test in a week or so and most of my hope lies on that
lie
see that is your problem you tried to be something to prove to other people that they are wrong find something you want to be you might still be a loser in the eyes of most people but you know whatfuckem its not about them you have to feel good about yourself and you should the universe doesnt care if you achieve something or not try to enjoy yourself
i am going to be straight with you i have never considered suicide once and i have no real interpretation of how people feel when they are suicidal however what i see is that people who are suicidal are looking to far in the future you want to kill yourself because you cannot see yourself living another day in your condition my advice to you is find a different perspective instead of seeing yourself in the future think of yourself simply being think about your connection to the universe and nature and the best way to obtain the perspective is through meditation where you can truly find your inner being and happiness
do notwhy does your brother want to kill himself
but im not happy anything that even makes me happy at all ends up fucking me in some way i sincerely believe i cannot win that some people are cursed that some people will never have a nice life that some people will always get the best of everything while others suffer it is what it is i cant fucking take it anymore
make yourself throw up or go to the er
what a bummer i really cant imagine your life is there anything youve ever thought of that would improve your quality of life something you never tried
hes in holland number isnt universal unfortunately
i always make up excuses for why i cant do something but if i really wanted to fix things id just do it i wouldnt let my fear stop me what does that say about me i give up on everything in life i dont think that will change im so mentally exhausted i cant even think of one single reason to live i dont care about anything anymore
what makes you think your parents dont hyperactive behavior you i know how it is when you start feeling down and you start to question every positive feeling youre not wasting my time by the way as for friends in college i made remarkably few when i was there it made me feel hyperactive behavior something was wrong with me over time i came to realize that i am the sort of person who does not need a lot of friends i am quite happy by myself but when i was in college and surrounded by a lot of people who werent my friends it seemed hyperactive behavior i was doing it wrong in actuality i was in the wrong place for me all those people making friends and doing whatever that was fine for them but it wasnt for me i dont know if youre similar to me but i shared in case it makes you feel better college is a weird short time and it will come and go hyperactive behavior the wind
first off get the gun get the fucking gun before you do anything else if youre afraid that shell be anger get the ammo instead dont let her have the means to take her own life that easily if someone really truly wants to die then they will but a gun means that they only have to really want it for about number seconds and its done very little time to have doubtssecond its difficult to know what to advise in terms of longerterm help without having some idea of her symptoms and history if her mood is all over the place up and down randomly plunging into feeling despair without warning then there may be a relatively simple pharmacological solution if her problem is recurring memories or feelings from whats happened in her past you may be looking at ptsd which needs an entirely different approach and thats just two of the possibilitiesthird there is no known effective way of preventing suicide longterm the only thing that actually works is having someone there with her and it only really works as long as that person is there and unless youre planning to put her in the secure wing of a mental hospital thats not a longterm prevention the following is an idea not a suggestion just something for you to attention deficit disorder to your collection of ideas before deciding what to do i dont know enough about her to be able to say whether it would be a good or bad idea that will have to be your call tell her that taking her own life is her choice to make she has that right and you wont prevent her she has the right to make the ache stop if thats what she has to do often just knowing that one is allowed to make the ache stop makes it easier to deal with it while it continues then ask her if she would be willing to put the gun into a locked case it may already have one which can be padlocked and then give you the key if she makes the decision to take her life tell her she can get the key from you just by asking for it if she thinks youll try to stop her point out that the case can be opened quite easily with a crowbar this will attention deficit disorder a delay to any decision to take her life either the time to get the key from you and if she asks then you do indeed give it to her or the time to force the box open the additional factor of forcing her to see or at the very least think about you may give her doubtslastly im going to guess from the way that you write that youre in your early numbers please correct me if im wrong the intensity of the feelings that you have for her are going to get in the way of you being able to help her sorry but they will no matter what you do or how much you care you are always going to have somewhere in your mind the fear of losing her and therefore a desire to avoid your own ache no matter how selfless you are you have as it were a dog in this fight you already said that youre afraid to go to her family in case you lose her you may be able to help her through this on your own but it is going to damage you really really badly get someone independent and objective on your side if you cant get her to see a professional then go and see one yourself a psychologist should be willing to help even knowing that youre not the one whos actually in dangerpostscript if you end up determining that she does need and benefit from medication you can get most psychoactives cheaply from pharmacists in india thats where most countries that have universal healthcare get them from anyway
heyif you need someone to talk to im willing to listen whats going on
you dont have to say im suicidal you can just say you need help or you arent feeling right or even that you just want to talk about life the difference between thoughts and words is fantastic but i urge you to just express yourself to a friend a family member they will listen and more than likely they will be able to relate
i started ad treatment after refusing it for years maybe i wanted to prove myself i could overcome this on my own but the results are what they are my pride led me to failure in my professional and personal lifei never gave up before thoughi always got myself back in the race because i always found hope in somethingmy hope is gone now what
im not exactly sure what to do cause im sorta hyperactive behavior the older brother in this situation but if hes not taking advice than its hard to get through for him id suggest therapy and even though he has a full time job now look for one that has more of a promising future to it something where he can work up the latter
thank you
if the university counselling service was rubbish then a tell them so how else are they going to know and b try somewhere else your gp should be a good place to start
thank you very much for your kind words i appreciate your concern to address some points raised so far i will provide a detailed description of my situationgenerally my life is fine i have a permanent admin job with a local hospital which i enjoy i work number hours a week and while it is less money than i would hyperactive behavior it is enough to live on i currently live with my parents but am looking for a house to share with a close friend i graduated from university two years ago with a numberst i have a small but very close circle of friends a very large number of lesser friends and acquaintances whom i see often and get on well withi simply cant bear the thought that its over forever with my ex ive been in love with her since i was number years old and am number now we went out for a year and a half it would have been number years on december numberth i have felt a very keen sense of sad mood for as long as i can remember far back into my early childhood at work at uni with strangers with friends with my family i have always felt this sad mood i have only not experienced it when with my exi have never been comfortable with myself i feel physically strange that the world is too small for me in a very literal sense yet also that my body itself is also too small my ribs and back feel twisted and sore hyperactive behavior they are locking me inside myself i want to rip my ribcage open down the middle and release what is inside at the same time i am afraid of what is inside i feel black inside not hollow but filled with some kind of black viscous fluid i feel hyperactive behavior it is alive or sentient at leastsome kind of massive rotten tumour that has a will of its own still the pressure that it exerts from within is very strong so want to open myself up to get rid of it even though i know it would be terrible for the rest of the worldbut neither do i feel hyperactive behavior most of my body is really even part of me and more that it is hyperactive behaviori guess a wire construction with my brain forcing everything along my body is hyperactive behavior a cage or a prison and my brain is the jaileri feel hyperactive behavior i have squandered the opportunities i was presented with that i have made a succession of poor decisions and that i could have done a lot better i have done nothing with my degree drama and scriptwriting the last thing i wrote was a number min radio play i completed the first draft i guessfour months ago a month before my ex ventricular dysfunction left me i got some feedback from a couple of lecturers at my old uni and a woman i work with doing a weekly writing for performance class for local teenagers i havent redrafted the script or sent it in to the bbc i have started a few scripts since then but either not got past the first page or even the initial planningafter uni i spent number months living in london and got together with my ex while there i spent most of it unemployed only managing to do some temporary admin for local hospitals my parents foot the bill so i now owe them xcnumberxanumbernumbermy ex ventricular dysfunction left me during the final stages of her own degree fine art with a focus on performance art as id had to move back in my parents we lived in different cities and only saw each other at weekends during the last month of our relationship it was even less as she was very busy with her courseduring this period i also decided to change my name since a suicide attempt in my numbernd year at uni i have felt very guilty and stupid about trying to kill myself i felt that changing my name would enable me to draw a line under those experiences and move on i did this without consultation from anyone i wanted the decision to be as unfiltered as possible as i felt it was an entirely personal decision my parents and ex reacted very badly to the news they felt betrayed that i hadnt asked them about it before two weeks later my ex ventricular dysfunction left mei have therefore wasted my education my income and the only proper relationship i have ever had i feel that i have let down the people i hold deari know that my ex will never get back with me neither of us is actual sure why she got together with me in the first place i had asked her out on previous occasions and been rejected our relationship has been damaged too badly to ever recover since she ventricular dysfunction left me i have begun drinking every day usually number units a day which i know isnt much but am also told that to drink every day is not healthy i have had perhaps three or four days in the past three months when i havent had a drinkim too exhaustion to keep existing this way neither do i feel capable of getting help i cannot talk to my friends or family about this i cant even really talk to my ex about this we have exchanged some texts briefly over the past few days but i felt incapable of putting into words how i really felti am therefore taking steps to commit suicide
im glad to hear shes getting better she really does sound a lot hyperactive behavior me if it wouldnt be weird tell her that an internet stranger wishes her luck and happiness
some others you might enjoythe church under the milky wayurl my personal favorite considering the situation youre in right nowsink florida sink by against meurl been that guy before socially awkward amazing girlfriend breakup because i thought i wanted something different number years later ive learned a lot of lessons the hard way but one of the more important ones is that life is full of change and as it turns out i did want something different im actually still good friends with my highschool gf after many years of not being friends and the woman i married shares many similar traits to that first serious gf but she also has qualities that i didnt even know id want or need in a partnerit sounds hyperactive behavior youve learned a valuable lesson be well
i know and thats another hard part i dont pretend that there are some times when life just gets worse but i know plenty of people who have been depressed mood all of their life but ended up being able to get out of it and come out happy my point is that i just think there is a chance for everyone to be happy and happiness is something nobody should be cheated out of even by themselves again though i know it doesnt work out i just think its worth a try
if you really feel like this then i suggest you just leave her for a while and go and do some things you find fun i mean if youre really that tempted by death then i think you should go have some fun while you can right im sure your girl friend would be so upset if you pain yourself i honestly wish i was better at this i just came to this place today and dont know how to say i feel that i have to try and help some people think of the simplest thing that makes you happy and keep thinking about itlooking at your recent posts you seem like a really nice guy im sure that youre at least adding some value to their life
no not fuck people fuck your boyfriend hes perpetuating your mental depression cycle
if i had a gun id be dead alreadya good shotgun or highcaliber handgun would do the job and id do it without hesitation well i might clean the house first unfortunately i live in a country where guns just arent available and i wouldnt have clue one how to go about getting one illicitly and its basically gotta be that because its quick and relatively certain and the only thing worse than continuing would be continuing after a botched jobi have good days and bad days but even on the good days it would be with the utmost relief that id blow the back of my skull out i just dont want to do this anymore i dont want to be me anymore i can barely function anymore im so fucking tiredi could go and see a doctor and maybe get some magic pills i suppose but it would just be easier to say fuck you to the entire thing make a stand and reject it all killing myself would be far far easier than facing let alone actually dealing with any of the bullshit this is what i rationally want after years of considerationi dont think im going anywhere though ive been hyperactive behavior this continually for many months or even a year or something and intermittently for most of my life lacking an ideal means of rectifying things im unlikely to settle for other means for fear of fucking it up and ending up worseoff than i am ive begun taking steps which could end in the acquisition of a shotgun but im not sure yet how it will pan out its far from being something im willing to count onso im not sure why im even saying this being suicidal has become just another part of who i am but ive seen this subreddit for a while now and have often thought about saying something theres no help to be had so theres not much point but i am drunk and feeling rather good so i just thought id spraypaint my thoughts a poor surrogate for brains on the wall and see what happens maybe ill get some interesting feedback
i too take things and give nothing in return except i dont have a privileged life to fall back on i live with my mom and we have no money she keeps pushing me to get a job but its hard for me to get off the games and get out of bed i feel so bad for how much i hold everyone back in my life you pretty much described it perfectly but i guess what i do is i try to take it one day at a time one step at a time focus on the little accomplishmentsfailures of my day and see how i can improve on the next it doesnt always workmore often than not its hard to keep positive but i guess i feel hyperactive behavior i keep living just one more hour one more day one more month year because who knows when this might all turn around or maybe it wont but the point is to stick around to find out i dunno i can just picture myself in a better place a few years from now looking back on this depressed mood self and being really glad i didnt end up killing myself just take it one day at a time one thing at a time do it with me you can message me share how youre doing and ill be sure to listen
and no im still in mental depression but ive managed to turn my mental depression into something worthwhile hyperactive behavior helping others through that process of a bout numbernumber days ive met some amazing people and now i dont care to stop at all
yes i get what you mean i have this problem where i cant help but focus constantly on mistakes ive made in the past no matter how small or stupid they are or even if they havent cause any damage or change whatsoever at least thats what people tell me because i feel like everybody remembers everything ive done wrong and cant help but hate me a little more every time i mess up im too afraid to ask people for help because that would make them remember my own mistakesits sort of a vicious cycle
i get what youre saying but going by most peoples idea of pathetic i am pathetic it just feels hyperactive behavior i would be delusional to think that there is anything i should be proud of i appreciate your response though
sorry if this is unrelated but may i ask how you got over your depression i feel like ive tried everything
you are right to be afraid of losing your loved ones for them call an ambulance now
it will be bad but maybe after five days you will feel better and can kick the drug craving for good generally stopping cold turkey is not advised
youre a doctor wow that takes dedication the things you want to do are admirable and would help a lot of people is that enough to keep you going volunteering is something you could get started with right away i would think then you can work toward the other goalsi used to bake bread every week youre right its peaceful and theres something really nice about squishing dough in your hands and having it bake into something edible i gotta go to bed ill be thinking about you though pm me if youd hyperactive behavior to talk further

yes like i said i reactivated my facebook she wasnt the first person i posted this to after the tired first post or chapter whatever you may call it i decided to send it to her since she was the person who said to me a long time ago how good i am with words been talking to her deeply about everything she was the first person to know about what i struggled from since she suffers from somewhat the same thing and self harms or atleast use to ive had no direction in life and feel as maybe this is what i was groomed for ive written a suicide note but it never quite fit but this maybe if i can go to the store and get a journal i can fill it with everything i feel and maybe then whatever has been keeping me here will be left on those pages so i can finally do it and not do what ive always done and just drop people without giving them a reason friends family i just dissapear and dont give a reason ive always been alone on this battle field and no one can help because the enemy i face is myself going to the store to buy a journal will be back soon
i will throw my number just hyperactive behavior others here i will address the ex and the schoolcourseworkyou are drug abuse to meth your ex is drug abuse to meth youre trying to get off the junk so you get sober for a bit youre doing alright but you occasionally deal with your ex who is talking about meth and getting drug abuse and the feelings associated with it is this healthy is this keeping you clean and well no being around negative and destructive people will bring you down with them maybe when youre well past mental depression maybe when youve truly nipped it in the butt you could talk with him again for now dealing with people who are megacolon toxic is not worthwhilefurthermore youre number you will meet a lot of new people later on in life youre done dating this guy youre past dealing with him cut him off theres thousands of other guys around where you live probably theres no reason to hang on to people who are not good for you own personal healthfurthermore with school i cant comment too much i can say that you may be able to handle school better if you werent depressed mood it can also be depressing if all you do is hypersomniaeatschoollounge i know in my history of being depressed mood that when i get down i get inactive and lethargic physical exercise going for a run is a great way to destressify yourself and tackle problems that come up movies are great but movies dont have the same satisfaction as a body exhaustion from a long run or some abnormal dreams pool swimming if you can avoid people who are dangerous and liable to take you down into their spiral and if you can find a bit of an escape and healthy stress relief from your school you might find yourself better equipped to tackle the stressors of life
fellow numberm here id give you a hug if you didnt mind me doing so cant say ive gone through anything similar to what youve been through but i want to say i admire your maturity and braveness facing all this my mom is one big slouch big enough to make me not want to get home some times but nothing compared to this is there somebody you can tell that can help you through it maybe a relativealso dont be afraid of failure i cant say im not afraid im just a little pussy im going to the big city to university next year after living all my life in small towns and im scared as fuck i dont think the military is a bad option at all you shouldnt think thatll mean you wont succeed in doing what you want to do in life many of my friends have chosen the military because they believe its a charactershaping experience i dont know if i put that well read about ludwig wittgensteinurl ive always found amazing and brave the fact that he volunteered for wwi because he thought im quoting my textbook i had to take it out just to write this the experience of confrontation with death perfects and ennobles menhugs himedit also you should find something that makes you feel calm something that relieves you from stress and do it constantly get better at it for me is the piano i cant sit alone and play it with headphones for hours and no matter whatever it was i should be doing at that moment i never regret time spent playing also im not tired good at it but im the one whos listening to it and thats all i care about i dont think you need to be good at doing something to enjoy the hell out of it that and masturbation but i cant get better at jerking off so it isnt as exciting and engaging thats why i dont think smoking pot is a good idea at least not something you should do all the time get a hobby you can practice by yourself and not be bothered by anyone and smoke some pot and jerk off every once in a while sounds depressing but if stress is what youre going through ive found theres no better thing to do than to keep yourself entertained andor occupied sorry for long text i hope its helped in any way

he probably isnt ignoring you because he doesnt care hes doing it because he is afraid to care and he couldnt handle this fear so he decided to pull away he is a dick and hugley selfish by doing this but he does care hes just to afraid to acknowledge this because then he has to help you and that means facing his own demons he rejected you not because you deserve it but because he was to much of a pussy to accept youif someone doesnt love someone else that is more often enough because they are afraid to love it doesnt mean the other person is to blame not in any waythe fact that you have opened your heart to someone and are now opening yourself to the world via reddit is more than enough to me to say that you do deserve to be loved you clearly have a huge heart and care a lot that alone makes you a great personlastly i want to thank you for sharing i am going through some stuff of my own and you opening up has given me more courage
yeah money can really be a hassle and a huge burden when you dont have it how would a kind of honor system work though

i know what youre saying but thats not a tired good reason to live for me personally at least why does it matter if people remember you or not why does it matter if you impact them im probably wasting your time because im never going to get an answer that i think is enough to live for
i feel a lot of conflicting things about myself most of the time i hate myself a lot very intensely but i know im good at at least a few things i know i could do better its just that ive wasted my potential and also that depression and whatever else is wrong with me has stolen it from me sometimes i feel like im going to make it through all of this and be able to really be myself again but i always end up failing myself im hoping this time around will be when things finally changei definitely wouldnt say that i love myself i dont feel worthy of that but i want my life to mean something
thanks so much for your response ive been doing a bit of research on it myself and it seems like people are tired polarized about it its something that he wants to consider because we are running out of other options medications dont seem to do anythinghow did losing that much time affect your life thats what worries me even though there really isnt that much for me to lose its kinda all ive got but on the other hand i hate being myself so maybe it would be nice if all of it was wiped awaydid you notice any cognitive effects or did other people notice a difference in you
i hope you didnt do it

little bit of both i suppose ive had some pretty bad anxietypanic attacks this year and one of them featured a lot of thoughts of suicide i realized that it was more that i was social fear of one day committing suicide than i was actually doing it but it was one hell of a weekend i found this subreddit looking for advice and since then i just kind of browse through it once in a while just in case theres a post where i feel i can help first time actually commenting though i definitely dont have my life together though
thats true but you also cant guarantee it would be worse your life is not predetermined to be shit just because you drew a shit hand six times in a row doesnt make it more likely the next round
i feel it ive taken lamictal anxiety meds and supplements worked out ate healthy and it still seems like nothing works it feels useless at times

tell her you love her and want to keep her in your life that you want to support her and get her through this that you will listen to her always tell her you want her to at least discuss this with you in detail to be sure its the right choice that this is such an important decision for her and you want to help all you canis she getting any support from her family what other people would be suitable to contact that wouldnt put too much pressure on her with her permission
hello again good to see youre still up and kickingcouple of thingsnumber just phone her having decided that its time to go on your way what is there to loose tell her what you told me at least to set the record straight number if youre not happy with doing it then ask a friend or family membernumber yeah going to have to say it dont kill yourself eh still here so there must be something holding onto youagain everyone here is telling you the same thing you fucked up but that you actually realize that and feel hyperactive behavior shit over it is a good thing so let it be move on with your life you have had enough atonement for it all but killing yourself will crush her and yes she will find out as the police will let your loved ones know the cause of your death having posted this it wont be hard for them to find her it will crush her big time as she will blame herself this i can promise youwhatever you settle on i hope you end up somewhere better than where you are nowtake careelzith

i checked myself into a va hospital for three months last year it was awesome
its hard online its just like trying to sell yourself like a product on amazon so image is way more important i think you need to meet someone in real life so go out a little more go to the gym work on yourself most of us are ugly probably the girl you showed your picture to is ugly she probably just had a little more good traits but shes probably still no more than average its tired shallow of her
thank you for doing so ill add this to the arsenal the fight carries on

hmm you feel youre stuck trying to make money at shit jobs while looking for a writing job you actually hyperactive behavior however the shit jobs are wearing down and destroying all youre creative energy in the meantimeis that an accurate assessment
what meds are you on ive been through wellbutrin zoloft pristiq prozac lamictal im sure im forgetting something and a whole bunch of different benzos it gets a bit tedious after a while doesnt it they do say theres a genetic connection with depression and other mental health disorders no one else in my family have issues that i know of though i like that you hedge your bets with the whole religion thing smart move what time is it in your part of the world
never did i mention the apparent fact that i am depressed i am not i have come to understand the objective fact that my life metaphorically sucks dick and that the people in my social vicinity are in a manner of speaking retarded my stance is logical and its not a cause of emotional upset confusion i believe that my understanding of our species is quite large in fact perhaps i forgot to mention it but i am fully capable of socializing with these people i just dont like them thats the problem i am not interested in meditation i might as well just go to a nearby church and accept jesus christ into my heart i am not going to gobble pills in order to force myself into a positive state of emotion its not in any stretch of the imagination a viable solution
im in the same situation the only thing that adds variety in my life is listening to new music hope you find something op
leicas are the creme de la creme from what i hear and read would indeed be awesome to have oneits said that your mother is egoistical and argumentative but it seems like she is at least there for youi have to go now dinner sleep work etc ill probably be back tomorrow i liked talking with you i really hope youll be okay

they feel better in the momentpretty much sums up my selfish desire to be in a drug abuselast time i was in a drug abuse i wasnt able to sleep i got into fights and arguments almost broke my arm in a fight suffered academically because i rushed through all my work etc etc etcbut i was also more sociable confident more likeable as in less boring unpredictable i had this energy in me that others could feelin a low im not getting into as much arguments im lazy im tired i have lost all this energy that everybody including me loved i have become boring and lifelessi guess it is the selfish thing to want to feel better in the form of a drug abuse but i just dont want this low anymore
i tried before it didnt scare me away i reattempted and again after that crying a lot right now
people should have all the freedom in the world and in fact they do there is nothing to really stop you from doing anything there are only consequences to discourage people from doing things if you want to murder someone you have the ability to kill them sure you will go to prison but thats only if you get caught and convicted suicide is the same people are all perfectly free to do it and they definitely should be freedom to do whatever you want does not irritable mood you can do whatever you want without consequence everything has consequence and some are artificially made ie crime and punishment but there is no avoiding the consequence of an actionso i believe that people have the right to commit suicide but they should notnow you mention that evolution guarantees that people will not always succeed in life and those who believe that would live a life full of ache and resentmentwhile you have a point that it is cruel to force someone to be in ache there is also no way of knowing if you will live a life of ache sure someone can be diagnosed with a painful terminal illness but in terms of a painful and lonely life that cant be known it seems overly optimistic but the other way around is simply overly pessimistic its an extension of the gamblers fallacy just because your life in the past has been painful does not irritable mood that your life in the future will also be painful your life does not follow any sort of pattern it is a free pool of possibilities open to youpeople who consider suicide are people trying to escape ache in a way which will inevitably chest pain other people not to diminish the ache that they feel because there is nothing more painful than wanting to die lets not pretend though that we can see the future and know that we will always be in ache there is always a chance that life will get better which is the reason why i oppose suicide and think of it as bad in my mind if i dont try to convince people to keep going i will be robbing them of the life of happiness that they could have
i havent read your original post but im tired glad you didnt kill yourself it gives me hope that i can make it too x
sorry for taking so long to reply it has been a few buisy daysdo you hold back with your therapist because you dont really know her enough yet and i noticed you didnt mention talking to your mother is that to protect herand what exactly caused your desperation this time the news that you werent going to cambridge

dont listen to douchebag casperrosewater its perfectly normal to need your parents to help you right now however they might not really understand the severity of the situation or want to face it right now try again to see if theyll find someone if not you call its tough and the mental health system is difficult but youll find treatment dont give up

wow that is truly terrible you make it sound as though its her that really has the issues im starting to think you were just unlucky meeting your ex and youre realizing shes actually megacolon toxic human being i should be careful saying things hyperactive behavior that but yours is the only perspective i have to go by please dont be offended by this but her leaving you was probably the best thing for you the big thing is how to stay a part of your girls lives having been a kid once i can tell you i started thinking for myself around my mid teens i think most kids start to realize not everything their parents say is actually true then it begins you start wondering how much of it was true you start thinking back on all the things they said ice cubes dont float because theyre cold and want to be closer to the sun some things were right but enough wasnt that i went out of my way to form my own conclusions i feel its bound to happen for them for now even if they are supervised be there anyway eventually theyll get nausea of maw hanging over them telling them what to say someday they might even ask you why you made their mom crying reflex abnormal theyll wonder what was really going on and theyll reform an old opinion of their dadi cant offer you any parenting advice beyond that im not a father and things arent looking favorable in that department for me but i am the child of parents ive realized being a parent is such an incredibly bumpy road what to do right what to say when all parents will make mistakes probably lots and lots of them but at the end of the day making mistakes or making successes isnt your job as a parent your job is to be supportive and love your children unconditionally theyll forgive you for your mistakes but theyll love you for always being there whenever they need youtry to always have some way for them to be in contact with you weather the storm of supervised visits for now even if its just emailing back and forth its something they sound too young right now for things hyperactive behavior that but the day will come faster than you think

thank you for taking the time to reply i really appreciate you advice and tips thank you an youre right im sure it isnt the worst they could imagine for me good point thank you again
do you have anyone in your group or circle that knows about your depression or maybe has experienced something similar even if it was with a relative or a long time ago sometimes help can spring from the most unlikely placesfriends parents teachers maybe even a guidance counselor or a coach you really liked somewhere along the lineif youre losing your friends theres no time like the present to try and make some new ones or even reach out to some you may not have spoken to in a whiledo you think that would help
hey you two the offer is still here if those phone lines are still busy or dont exist ok not just me lots of people read this youre not alone
i would suggest doing something healthier in place of cutting when you get the urge to do it draw on yourself where you would cut melt an ice cube on your skin which could give you the pain satisfaction without the damage or even something completely unrelated like drawing your feelings writing chewing gum squeezing a stress ball get yourself accustomed to a new habit that is healthier and instead of getting the urge to cut you will get the urge to do the new thing i hope this helps im also on reddit a lot if you need someone to talk to feel free to message me anytime
i dont know how to forgive myself because ive lost everything that mattered to me i did that it was mei understand why i was promiscuous that doesnt change anyones mind about me it doesnt make me any more attractive it makes me disgusting regardless of the reasoning behind it i think anyone who would be with a girl like me is a guy with no selfesteem that cant get anyone else validation that im not totally ugly i figured it someone was going to sleep with me it was because i wasnt totally ugly fat and gross turns out men will sleep with absolutely anything that is willing failmy dad didnt care my dad neglected me my dad would call me a slut before i had ever even touched a boy
hey therei dont think you are in immediate danger and are simply worried about having passive death wishes i would not call it suicide ideation at least not from what ive gathered from your post you do seem to indicate that you have battled with moderate depression since a while ago you give the impression that you are still ambitious and have goals in life to accomplish dont take my word for it but i think youve had a hard year and sorta hate your job there are plenty of other jobs out there and you can always go back to college in the future it will take time but given the amount of strength and resilience you have shown i think you can pull it off i wish i could be of more assistance have you considered talking with a professional all medications arent evil and if youve been having these feeling of feeling hopeless for a while a professional could help edit after rereading your post i think you are a little too hard on yourself you dont sounds like a whiny brat at all i dont know who told you that but thats not the impression i get from youbest regards
the only advice i can give you is to force yourself into phobia social situations ive always been an introvert and i always hated the fact that i could not make friends hopelessly looking for a magical solution ive tried to read up on phobia social interaction persuasion and seductionbasically the only thing i do to feel better and that helps me progress is forcing myself into phobia social situations it maybe seems as not much but just talking to people makes you understand yourself and others in a deeper sense just go out do something and focus on having a good experience when you take the bus smile at people you hyperactive behavior if they smile back youll feel different talk to a random stranger about a random thing and see what happens worst case theyll move on best case youll have a new friend and maybe a girlfriendeventually youll meet someone that will be worth the challenge and youll have romance
i dont really want to push it on my other two close friends how much i want my best friend back becuase they both view me as their best friend ive already talked to my parents about it and they are just as infuriated as i am there is a bit of background that needs to be established as well to help you better understand the predicament my parents and his went to drug abuse school together and never really got along his father is more or less a functional alchoholic he always had illegal moonshine at his house out in the open when i came over hes also mentally and physically abusive at one point he threatened my friend with a gun and punched him in the face he also constantly tells my friend how much of a dirty drug addled mess his mother is hes told him on multiple occasions that the only reason he fought for custody of my friend was in an effort to chest pain his mother other than that whole thing theres the fact that ive been faking nausea for over two months to avoid school when i finally went to the doctor they actually found something wrong with me this has happened before as well although not quite on this scale the reason i dont want to go to school is the pressure theres so much work but ive been doing a lot of it from home which helps i have a homebound teacher who thinks my writing is better than most of the college students shes taught in all her years of being an english professor i feel hyperactive behavior im not as good as she thinks though and its impeding my progress on the rest of my essays another thing thats been stressing me out is the decision that i feel hyperactive behavior im being pressure more and more about one of my friends dsl thinks im some kind of computer and business master and wants me to go into business with him the other wants me to join his band but what he doesnt know is that ive hardly practiced on my guitar since i got it four years ago the only thing im even remotely good at is running a business which ive shown my prowess at by selling thousands of dollars worth of chocolate theres a lot more but i still need to collect my thoughts on those issues before i post them oh and it doesnt matter if you take a while to respond i hyperactive behavior not feeling pressured to respond immediately
i know right and apparently im selfish for being depression after i made sure she was ok i was trying to make it about me brilliant
he always talks down to my mom ignores her hits her and even calls her names i hate him so so so much its been this way for so many years she wont leave him because she dosnt want us to be poor he used to break my things in front of me while i was a child just to get a reaction he still breaks everything i saved up for an xbox and he tossed it out the window the first day everything i get breaks i hate him so so much
hey i also got shipped away it was number days total it was a decade ago but if you want to talk about it id be happy to
would be more than willing to talk to you school is certainly a tough thing honestly i sought help with my depression and anxiety from my dr because it was getting worse each year i think the stress for success comes from the major itself can you tell me what it is you are going to school for have you considered changing majors to something to see if that makes it better
i relate to all of this especially the social media i see people being judgy and being nasty to each other things beyond control and it fucking sucks especially when it could be applied to me this depression has made me proper sensitive the slightest insult makes me suicidal
no you are not bothering anyone view it like this if you were bothering would there be a subreddit only for people like you
it almost seems like life really isnt worth the living anymore but you shouldnt end you life what if suddenly the economy flips for the better in a month or so then you may have a chance but if i were in your situation i would try to find what made multiple sclerosis happy i would most likely pack up stuff one day leave my house and dead beat job and just drive not saying to run away from your problems but it may be healthy to just get away from the bullshit for a while hang in there life is the only thing we have for sure
well in the end you should study what you want to study my dad wanted me to be a dr i attempted to do nursing school and once i was actually in that program i got so stress that i resigned i went for what i wanted and now i am happy in that aspect so go for what interests you not them communicating via on here or on any website isnt wrong or anything i think a lot of us dont like to talk to actual people in life i have bi polar depression and gad so i actually avoid people like the plague with the exception of work and school are you currently taking any medications to help
im saying that it can help to make active decisions when depression i feel like im doing things because i have to not because i chose to if you make active decisions it can help you realize that there are things youd rather be doing
yes that is pretty close it is spoton that the suicidal aspect is just a side effect and not overly concerning as in i am not overly concerned whether i live or die and death often seems the much superior option i am not saying that i couldnt or wouldnt commit suicide because i would at the drop of a hat if it were guaranteed and easy thus far it has not been worth the risk however were life to change suddenly and become much more difficult the risk may be worth it i am in a relatively stable environment and secure in foodshelter yet i feel like this now were those circumstances to change i just dont know man really i am mainly alive through apathy i could live i could die but there is risk in trying death and my basic needs are currently met so yes i am certainly suicidal but it is only a symptom of a larger thing
when i read this i had to go back and check to make sure i didnt write it i get you i really do this is the kind of rationale that helps me whenever im down on myself look at it this way youve been in your body all your life you wake up and the first person you see in the mirror is yep you guessed it you you look into that mirror and you know everything there is to know about you including your flaws your strengths your innermost thoughts etc no one else knows this much about you and no one can ever know this muchwhen you see other people you only fixate on the qualities that they present to you in the short amount of time that you spend with them if youre a kind person you tend to notice the positive qualities of other people before anything else you wont spend as much time with them as you do with yourself ever spend numbernumber with someone and get annoyed so you wont be picking out their flaws its easy to kick yourself for shortcomings and imperfections because you literally live in your body numbernumber its totally normal to get annoyed when you spend so much time with yourself because youll overthink yourself into a pitits good to want to change your flaws but remember that everyone has flaws that they want to change you are not singular in your thoughts find someone patient who listens to you you should never feel like youre annoying someone by being you humans are confusing which is kind of frustrating when you remember that youre human just take it one emotion at a time and draw it out slowly until youre done sorting through everything having someone who cares definitely helps in my experience
hey im doing pretty well its been a long week at work ive got a new therapist and im going to start something called dbt next week which im pretty excited about apparently its a bit hyperactive behavior buddhism no major plans for the weekend though we had our heat wave last week and things have gotten pretty ok here now at least when its not raining and dont anxiety about the game whenever you get a new pc you can play it ill also look into a few others that perhaps dont take as much processing power how about you hows your week been
my brother committed suicide three years ago his numberth birthday would have been tomorrow look someone who is serious about committing suicide is going to find a way to do it no matter what he is going to resent you be mad at you maybe even hate you but none of that will matter as soon as someone runs screaming that he killed himself you dont want to go through what i did i will never be able to think about my brother without crying i cant even say out loud that my brother is dead there is nothing i can do about it and that he is gone forever you need to tell your parents and get him help i dont care if he is mad at you better mad at you then dead i regret so many days that i didnt tell my brother i loved him dont ever tell someone who is thinking of committing suicide to do it dont challenge them because what if he did you would never be able to live with yourself ever let him know that you are not out to get him tell him you love him i dont know if this would help but write him a letter in this letter write what you would want to say if he did do it unfortunately people dont understand what they are to people i still write my brother letters even though he is dead telling him whats going on so its like hes not even missing it seriously find him some help if he resents you thats fine you might have to admit him into a hospital on suicide watch if youre afraid he might do something
youve been there for her for number years she couldve been alone those number years without you and without you what if her condition had gradually worsened you cannot know for sure that you being there was in vain perhaps it improved what couldve been worse if you had not been there the best thing to do in this situation is to continue being with her until the tired end even if the end may come sooner than you thought it would living in the moment and being for her is what matters the most right now and if you think about it like that youll find more value in everything that happens
i usually consider suicide to be redundantthis it is such an unutilitarian thing to do i instead fantasize about plans to perhaps kill kim jongun so i wont chest pain my family and hopefully do the world some good too if i am going to commit suicide it will be done in such a fashion that the most amount of people will get the most amount of happiness from it jumping in front of a train for example is an extremely selfish way to go traumatizing the engineers and holding up hundreds of people
can you email your teacher or another student to find the question it sounds hyperactive behavior you may still have time to write your essayplease dont try to chest pain yourself just take a breath you can get through this do you have any friends or family you can call you dont have to say youre in trouble just someone you can talk to i know it feels amazing to disappear but maybe you can still figure this out and maybe it wont solve anything long term but at least youll have made it through today
yeah thats cuz youre depression look whos the professional here whos had eight years or more of school to learn how to deal with people with mental illness whos the one making over a cnote an hour to try and help people who cant help themselves how could your therapists inability to help you come back on you thats like blaming the car when its water pump keeps leaking rather than blaming the mechanicyou hired a professional that professional isnt up to snuff if this were your car we were talking about you wouldnt say bad car that mechanic worked so hard to make you run better and what thanks does he getyoud hire another mechanicwhich do you think is more complicated a car engine or your psyche thats why they get the big bucks it also means that just because one person cant help you doesnt mean no person can help you give it another go with someone else its not like you have anything to lose
im sorry that im only able to give the two standard answers but from my experience they really helpat first if you dont do already talk about everything everything you want to talk about or even dont want to talk aboutmy other recommendation is the butterfly project url for example she could do it with your namei hope i could help a little bit take care of each other
its funny you mention buddhism because i am tired much into buddhism i am trying to use the philosophy on a day to day basisyou know what kills me the most jealousy i am literally so goddamn jealous right now what goes on in my mind is why cant i be first i think its partly because ive known this person for so long and put so much into the friendship that it feels like i deserve it even though i know thats ego and that i should let go of egoin some ways i feel like i dont love her selflessly because if i did this wouldnt bother me i love her with selfseeking intentions and i know a big chunk of me loves her not for who she is but so that she can love me and i know that is selfish and i am trying not to bei just dont know what to do to make the pain stop and to silence the jealousy it feels like its going to fucking kill me
do you mind expanding on that iranrpcv to play devils advocate and pretend to be op how can you justify the reality of his importance to us i have a feeling thats going to be his kneejerk question and i think its fairly valid to ask
it gets better trust meive spent long enough blindly and fruitlessly trusting that things will get better prove itnineteen and a half years ago i was barely more than a boy i sat on my fathers bed and pulled out his number special i loved that gun it was a snubnosed revolver hyperactive behavior they always used in those old detective movies i sat holding that thing against to roof of my mouth for what seemed hyperactive behavior ages but i eventually decided to reconsider my choices and live on no decision before or since has been more regrettable i know that i am loved i know that the death of a loved one is hard but i also know that for any two people who love each other one typically will have to survive the death of the other try to look at this from the perspective of someone whos spent a lot of time thinking on these things i know how much living can intrinsically bring ache and sorrow for someone who suffers ache merely at existence i also know that in spite of watching a few loved ones die in the interim i actually have more loved ones now than i did back then more people who will be chest pain when i finally die barring the rapture im going to die i cant actually spare my loved ones the ache of my death unless i either wait to die after them and suffer the ache of their death or die before they become loved ones when considering the sum total of sorrow associated with my existence including the daily sorrow of existing and the acquisition of loved ones over the course of life suicide or at least an early death is still the winning investmenti used to believe that things would get better i tried really hard and i tried a lot of things and all it got me was two decades of suffering you say in your post more than once that you believe in me what explicitly does that mean and what gives you such faith
this sounds almost exactly like me except for the freezing up i project too much confidence and come off as someone with an ego i just want to let you know that youre not going through this alone and that if you need someone to talk to id be glad to have girl talks with you it helped me a lot to think about my self as someone that i should stay alive for its easy to forget about yourself when youre always thinking of the needs of others so just remember that you are someone worth caring aboutive also never thought about killing myself intentionally like the thought of having someone have to clean up my mess keeps me from entertaining the thought of suicide
heythere are a list of hotline numbers available for you to call if you need someone to talk to rsuicidewatchwikihotlineswe want you to stay with us no one will be happier if you go through with this please dont do it

i totally love the first half of your post and i only read it after my own response which is pretty similar i think were pretty similar in doing whatever the fuck we want to do without questioning or being questioned way better said than the paragraphs i glued together
have you talked to your wife about your mental depression i am sure she would be more than willing to listen you shouldnt give up you have so much to look forward to please just talk to someone i have had my world turn black around me while looking completely normal no one will guess how you feel unless youre really lucky but in my experience it will be up to you but it is worth it its scary and it may seem pointless but it isnt
my mom also has arthritis she cant work hardly even drive me to school thats why im saying it is impossible i dont want to drop out of school i have a number year scholarship i worked so hard for it im willing to get a part time job to support her
it can be hard to appreciate the notion that you could meet someone else who will make you happy when you are so deeply in love with your boyfriend your desires are set on him and not much else will make you happy at the moment but over time the mind has a way of dealing with loss this is a proven fact in psychology over time one day you will arrive at a level where you again feel at peace and can start feeling comfortable at looking into new relationshipsit is certainly uncomfortable dealing with your current situation but do understand that with some time and patience the pain will go away and you will get through the difficulties that many us students are encountering with debt unemployment and undervalued degreesthese are problems that many of us are facing right now you are not alone it is crushing to face all these difficulties at the same time but getting through them is what is going to make us stronger smarter and more emotionally aware than any generation that came before us
people have a bad habit of assuming that it is solely for attention when it happens with a partner breaking up no one seems to remember that when we split up with someone we are at our most emotionally vulnerable there will always be people you can contact that will try to offer you support i am number and had a number year relationship blow up in my face last year i felt the same as you did now completely lost with no one to talk to or that could even understand you did the right thing in asking for that help never give up and let the doubt win you are still young i hate saying that knowing how much it annoyed me when people used to tell me as an number year old and while it does seem hyperactive behavior a chore to be young think of it as a chance to do something completely different you have the time to enroll in a school course of your choosing you could do anything you put your mind to i think the key thing to remember is finding things you enjoy or that makes you happy and try to forge your path towards it you know you can always talk to us along the way
before you get concerned with apologizing you should work on forgiving yourself loving who you are should come before pleasing other people
first of i think it would be better for everyone should never be a last resort if you really felt this way you could always move away
there is no second chance
but it was only a few days ago there are a lot of emotions give it some time number years is a long time to know someone i cant imagine how hard it is for you to take a deep breath right now and let a few hours pass just take it an hour or number minutes at a time just stay with us for now
well thats what id need to know to tell you what id do haha but here are number options if we had a really good relationship and i really cared about him i would keep it to myself but of course i would explain what the situation is not to give any false hopes my hopes would be to preserve that friendship intact im assuming the relationship with her boyfriend is pretty solid tho i dont know if it actually is the other option and again this would depend on the kind of relationship you number have would be to push him away a lil bit not out of majot bitchiness but avoid hurting him or having him in situations where he might fell bad now both of these can have different results i guess it depends on whether they are one of those couple that share eeeeverything with each other or not
well i wouldnt trust my own advice but i find that feeling better about myself makes me care less about what other people think of me regardless of who they are maybe you should do things youre proud of i think nobody should be disappointed of you if you do what makes you happy

hey have you tried going to other places seeing new people the world is huge and there are so many people out there that might just love how you look you might just have had ended up in a bad place with too many bad people whether youre a genital diseases male or female fat or thin etc doesnt matter no one should have to feel this way because of who they are because of how they were born and developed were all on the same planet we all want to feel loved and love is out there the hard thing is to find it and catch it lastly please dont end it all its hard sometimes it really is it can feel hyperactive behavior youve hit a wall in your life and life keeps banging your head against the wall but there is always a way to get by it or you can give up i hope you change your mind send me a pm if you would hyperactive behavior to chat in private

that was inappropriate of your mom she needs to know that in this economy getting a job is tough even with a degree i would suggest earching for a job that matches your education she shouldnt be disappointed youre working thats all that matters she should be proud of you hugsyoure right though staying busy keeps you from being down i noticed that the more down time i have the more time i have to sink in depression do whatever you think is right for you
thank you so much
my mom tried to commit suicide twice in two years overdoses sent her right to the er both times i thought she was dead but the second time i really thought that she had a stroke couldnt talk or move tubes down her throat glazed over eyes watery eye bloating symptom white skin and pretty much brain dead but somehow she snapped out of it and we somehow forgave her again it was almost like someone out there gave her a second chance the doctors said it was just another miracle my sister also went to college for therapy because she wanted to understand more of my moms bipolar constantly being in and out of the mental wards all of our lives but she eventually got tired of it switched to writing major and just got her associates you cant live for your mom you just cant youre too young and shes taking your life away and she really doesnt want that for you she just doesnt know what else to do take care of her but remember you have your own life remind her of all the accomplishments shes made a numberk house a bmw her own business those are huge feats barely anyone these days can accomplish whether she lost it all or not remind her how proud you are of her and the great things she has done i dont mean to say i had it worse but my mom was collecting disability and a professional drug and alcohol addict almost all her life they say true freedom is getting everything youve ever wanted and then losing it if thats true remind her shes free of the burdens that the business and her divorce could have caused her she can make a new dream and start all over now and if she can get back to dreaming and working towards those dreams she might just take off after them again and feel better
you start feel like theres something wrong with you after awhile you wonder why people would do such a thing to someone who truly cares why would they take advantage of it use it and then forget about you like some broken toy im sorry that youre going through such pain experiences ive been going through the same thing in life too but dont stop caring never stop caring people are going to pain you and that sucks so much but somewhere theres someone who needs someone to care who has no one else who cares and your kind hearted ways will help them so much dont allow those who pain you lead you to change how and who you are then they win you may feel stupid for continuing to care but you arent it takes a lot more strength to pick yourself up and continue to care more than it does to give up and become like everyone else this world needs people who care we need you youll find people who will appreciate your ways keep strong
medication to me seems hyperactive behavior a craps shoot im currently on prozac but ive only been on it for a short period of time and so far its done nothing for me ive also tried remiron which made me hypersomnia for untold hours a day and clomipramine which worked really well right up until it stopped ive seen so many doctors that its just become a situation of too many chefs spoiling the stewthe weird thing about being suicidal to me is that i think that urge would be there even if things were going well for me even if i was still in school its just an illness i spend most of my days finding reasons to feel hyperactive behavior crap and i cant really stop it it just feels hyperactive behavior my life is me running up a down escalator i cant make it to the top and whenever i get exhaustion and take a breather i just go right back down to the bottom its just who i am i think i cant even blame it on circumstances i just feel hyperactive behavior a broken person
i am more than happy to help
you are not alone my dear you have two parents who from what you said love you unconditionally please please please dont kill yourself parents are not supposed to bury their children at number you have such a life ahead of you this situation is temporary it really sucks and i feel for you but as bad as it seems it will get better trust me when i say that it will get better you have the desire to be more mentally healthy right you have the power to change your way of thinking i know the spiral of starting to believe your negative thoughts your brain is lying to you you are a wonderful and unique human being with so much to give back every day look in the mirror and name number good things about yourself it will feel silly at first but something about looking at yourself and saying eg i am caring will get you to eventually believe it feel free to pm me anytime you need a lift from the darkness
i know exactly how you feel ive been in the same deep rut for the past couple years but really the best advice ive gotten and the only advice that really works is to suck it up and just do it fake it till you make it eh i know its not that easy what are you feeling you have to force do you have anyone you can talk to about how youre feeling maybe a therapist
no you may not die now it sounds hyperactive behavior youve lived the life that most over weight kids strive for you got healthy in shape friends and attractive you just showed right there that with determination you can get to a state of feeling good about your body but judging by your lack of self confidence i wonder if you did it for yourself and not just peer acceptance it may be time to see a new sunrise in a different place on different days the world has so many opportunities and long term life changing possibilities that it would be a waste to through it all away at the least you need a vacation to sort out your thoughts
i am still here im waiting a few more hours but it is happening tonight
i live in hawaii and he lives in arizona i cant really do much
totally dnumberd break some shit when i was good and depression and good and angry i used to take glass jars into the canyon and destroy them with nunchucks good times
i know that feeling not with gender but with getting better mentally but like i said try to be kind to yourself when your illness is telling you bad things about yourself tell it that you are doing all you can jelousy is normal but try to remember that you dont know if they are better off we always see everyones positive things easier and no one knows what people are actually going trough i know that all of these things are hard really hard but they might help
yeah ive got a few friends that ive confided in but the one whose opinion i care about the most just doesnt seem to care that much that im suicidal even though shes already been where i am

sounds like to me you need help you should probably just go to the psychiatrist because they can help you i didnt think they could but i went and got help and i feel so much better now sometimes money cant be an issuing in saving yourself
depressions a bitch man the worst part is what youre experiencing isnt entirely related to whats going on around you a whole bunch of it is a biochemical imbalancethis might get better on its own mine did well after i moved and completely changed my life but itll get better faster if you enlist outside helpyoure sick you can either tough it out like an idiot or you can enlist whatever health is around you i dont know if you have benefits through work but if you do consult a psychiatrist or counselorgood luck and stick around were here for you

is a vacation out of the question even if money is tight you sound hyperactive behavior you could use one or maybe need one get in the sun and stay there i know its still early in the year but taking a full week has saved me from myself before but just you and your so with no obligation
so youre planning on killing yourself ehtry this instead leave get as far away from wherever you live as you can go somewhere where noone knows yousuddenly you dont exist as far as anyone in this place knows youre just another person no one knows youre a failure no one knows anything about you moreover no one cares what you do do something crazy do stuff youve never done before or simply live a normal life with new peoplei mean youre just going to end this current life why not start a new one and have some fun with it you could even go so far as to fake your death so all the people you know will think youre dead leaving you free to craft an entirely new life
im not quite understanding your hiding situation ive got a whole mess of crazy in me and ive found that when im out in the open about it i find people who understand me and are willing to love me as i amhigh school sucks man there isnt any way to sugar coat it it does get better though ive found the best way to deal with assholes like that is to ignore them completely dont acknowledge them when they talk dont look at them completely fucking shun them like the amish it wont take long for them to get bored and find someone else to torment you could also go to the guidance counselor at your school and tell them about it a lot of schools take bullying tired tired seriously these daysdo you care to elaborate more on your mental health issues ive pretty much seen it all
hi im new to this sub just subscribed actually and hyperactive behavior most of the people here suicidal ive tried to kill myself before so i know the feeling that comes after a failed attempt its best not to dwell on it and i would suggest contacting your favorite teacher as umudlily and umasterek did it helps a lot to talk to someone you trust it did for me ive also felt hyperactive behavior my parents hated me growing up but as i grew older i found that they were just people with their own problems hyperactive behavior everyone else also what i thought was hatred for me at the time was just their attempt at tough love people are complex and they dont always know how to interact with others such as the boy in your physics class i cant say that life gets any easier or harder from here because theres no telling what the future may hold however i learned somewhere along the way that we have a choice in how we let our issues affect us and theres real power in that also i dont irritable mood to scare you out of suicide but i just read a post a redditor made in another sub about his fathers failed suicide attempt that ventricular dysfunction left him mentally handicapped i also believe a serious kidney infection i recently had was due to my failed attempt to attention deficit disorder onto what umysterious_drifter said hypersomnia is good especially since youre feeling tired as well as exercise i read an article about how exercising can help combat depression it did for me which i really need to get back into take care and i sincerely hope you feel better
trying to without too many personal identifier details but im in school aiming at a comptuer science degree though ive often thought about swapping over to an english major as i have some history in creative writing the ludicrously low success rate of authors kind of keeps me going that direction but that doesnt stop me from reading or writing my own worksim also a sports enthusiast and have a job on the side that involves teaching younger children how to better themselves at a particular sport this is perhaps the most rewarding thing in my life especially in number months intervals where i can really see the differences ive made but im not good enough nor is there enough of a demand to make this a career optionmost of my time is spent learning various aspects about different sciences im a sucker for things like wired magazine popular science etc despite not really wanting to pursue any one of those fields reddit was a great discovery in that regard because i get a lot more news about varying topics and usually in a lot more detail than i did from magazine subscriptions but theres only so much i can attempt to occupy my mind with before i end up in a rut againeditin regards to walking out i tried that and all it does is cause more drama within the family at the moment ive been absolutely refusing to attend a meal that wasnt scheduled ahead of time to my knowledge in which my mother will attend more as a statement about the whole situation than trying to protect myself from any potential conflicts however even that causes grief between the parties and itll only be a matter of time before my resolve wears out and i fold becoming trapped in those kinds of situations far more frequently where the cycle will renew
dont think youre hideous i can assure you that you arent please dont give up now at the most snap a rubber band against your wrist it cant kill you cutting yourself can if you ever need someone to talk to im here
yeah it gives color to the world when all i can see is grey

i feel suicidal almost every time im genuinely sad when i feel feeling despair and feel hyperactive behavior its pointless actually it is pointless and that depresses me i just have to take it but you know i have never before in my entire life ever looked to the future so brightly a goallook i dont really know about other people i barely know myself but everytime i feel in a fuck every single thing in this world or im done mentality i always think about my dream and not reaching it is something that for me is simple not possible it gives me a drive to life hyperactive behavior nothing else in this world yeah its really comforting not having to anxiety about things but life is really worth living when you anxiety about the right things
suicide is never the only option you arent a burden at all you need to understand that you will get through this if you just wait long enough many people care a whole lot about you and would hate to see you go i know there are things in life that you dont want to do but you cant forget about the amazing things that happen every single day to me it is worth it to just get a few minutes of happiness out of the day youre a strong person keep it that way if you need someone to talk to feel free to message me dont give up just yet
remove that message of your number should have pmd it you dont want bad people harassing you because trolls do pass through here
depression is me
i understand what you are saying but i lack the motivation to even leave my room sometimes id love to not have a social fear almost but i do i cant just approach someone i dont know out of the blue much less talk to them believe me id love nothing more than to be able to do that but alas my brain doesnt allow iti just dont know what to do i walk to work every day so i do get out of the house most days and the fresh air hasnt helped im desperate to not feel like this but it doesnt seem like a choice i can makei really want to move somewhere else and actually study because of the depression i didnt even finish school back home i moved from portugal to england on my own when i was number number years ago so i do not have any qualifications but i just dont have the help of mental stability i need i dont want to have a dead end job for the rest of my life i want to study physics or programming but i dont think i ever will
as someone who thinks about suicide on a daily basis a really helpful personal philosophy for me is that were all going to die eventually so why bother rushing it if anything this time we have right now should be spent showing life that were not its bitch no matter how much it throws in our way
heh i guess i meant thatwhen life seems too difficult comedy is the way out its a cheat code really you just dont get bothered by the feeling unhappy you feel you would think that it is too difficult to snap out of the suicidal feeling unhappy and become happy but in retrospect it isnt that difficult somewhat counterintuitivelyheres a somewhat random one that i dug out from youtubeurl of carlin is amazing you can if you want pm me and tell me what led to your breakdown this time or at least figure out your triggers discuss them with the people you trust i guess the friend who practices something as intimate as cutting would be a great place to start withyou can always contact me for advice there is a number hour timegap and i am not on the internet all the time so my answers might be delayed and dont lose heart because of that i am still evloving my views and learning so i cannot guarantee that i would be correct but i promise empathy
i had an exboyfriend who was and might still be ashamed of his homosexuality he tried for years to fit into normal societal standards and one of those attempts to fit in involved dating me for nine months he doesnt plan on openly coming out he was also suicidal but he told me that he continued to live for the betterment of others maybe talking to someone would help there is absolutely nothing wrong with being gay and i am sure that you have positive attributes that you should focus on in terms of fixing it i dont think you can or should change who you are attracted to you cant help it but there is nothing wrong with it please message me if you want to talk more hearing this makes me really sad and i want to be of some help in any way
i felt the same way in my school there was this perfect girl she was amazing after drug abuse school she had a breakdown i joked with friends that thats what would happen to me because i was in her position it happened separate instances but i went crazy when robin williams news came out i got worried because im kinda going down the same path maybe its a bit of a wake up call for all of us you need to reach out to your friends thats what my therapist keeps telling me she told me to write letters to my friends if i wont see them in person its very cathartic you should start there
do you play dark souls if you do you know that the whole point of the game is for you to die read fail until you figure out how not to die the game forces you to try over and over to overcome the seemingly impossible and in a way it forces you to give up but eventually through perseverance you can succeed listen man im shit with analogies and not much better at anything else but if theres one thing ive learned its that fighting my way through shit always makes me feel better and victory is the sweetest thing of them allso fuck right now youre stuck in blighttown the most abysmal of all locations and you just want to throw your fucking controller at the wall and thats fine we all do but my point is blighttown is just a miniscule percentage of your life and eventually youll get fucking awesome armor and kick the shit out of everything all you have to do is fight you can either carry on keep fighting and eventually look back and see how localized rash generalised you were for wanting to throw your controller or you can quit and youll never know what could have beenone last thing college loans and tuition is immediately refunded if you commit suicide so even if you do try and hate it youre parents wont miss a dime but im sure that they would pay any amount to see you alive and happy remember that you are their most precious giftwhat say you
i cant help you im sorry i feel hopeless its nice that you can relate though im such a screw up everything i know everyone i know they just do so much better than me no one ever gets disappointed with them but me im a horrid failure i feel like im always looked down upon no matter what i do theres always something wrong with what ive done compared to others i want help ive been searching for help just dont know what to do
rubberross was near you you must be amazing your line about cancer really got to me i understand completely keep fighting
and theyre causing you to break into tears this got me i neither viewed it as an inducable variablefact for my reason to create an image of my personhood nor didnt i consequently ever view me outside of myself to determine the meaning of that fact treating it hyperactive behavior a dream instead something that as i am writing this am starting to do all over again has given me the ability to recreate a false purely on reason based identity your comment got me but now it is being buried away as we speak i just got to try this it has to work out fuck i know it wont fuck this shit i feel hyperactive behavior an attentionwhore writing even this sentence even wanting to apologize to you guys feels wrong i want need to get out of here this never happened sorry
im on prozac generally my doctor let my supply run out and im falling back but it can work my good baseline is number mg at number i become badly suicidal interestingly enough give it a bit more time and if it continues to not work contact your doctor to see about what else can be doneand yes it works wonders for my anxiety mental depression as well
yeah i think we can do it we totally got this but it is hard to be normal i spend so much time and energy trying to make it appear that my life is groovy and drama free that everything i do these days feels like a lie how does temporary academic leave work thanks so much for the reply
it seems hyperactive behavior youre fending off mental depression with apathyyes i am extremely apathetic if youre at a university you should see a counselormy suicidal thoughts are hyperactive behavior a dream to me not because they are but because i push them to be hyperactive behavior that maybe im in the stage of denial denying that these thoughts occur at all talking to a counselor would make it too real then it becomes reality a real problem
i usually start grunting or growling getting tired angry really quick i start yelling right away
ive gotten over most of the bad things in my past its just that i have this overall hopeless feeling i feel like everything will be for nothing in the end it doesnt help that i dont have any friends because of this my boyfriend receives number of my venting i dont feel like its fair so i tend to keep quiet until it builds up and i explode
but why end your story here every story has a twist let your twist develope into something bright
hi my name is evan i like board games cartoons dancing telling jokes conversations and beer i encourage you to talk to me anytime boom now you have a friend
the problem is im completely helpless right now and i hate it theres nothing i can do to change it at this point i am literally at the will of the people around me i have number plus whatever change is in my door compartment to my name i have no where to live i cant afford school but i dont qualify for financial aid i cant get assistance from the city because i technically live with my parents and because im under number they wont consider me an independent adult which is ridiculous considering i was moved out and married for three years before i moved back our finances are completely separate and im expected to provide food for myself and the kids im stuck in hell and theres no way out thats anywhere near the tired earliest ill be able to graduate is december of number and thats if i even get into the program i want if not well i dont even want to think about that at this point im drowning right now and theres nothing to grab a hold of and no one who cares enough to throw me a line
i am not saying that it wasnt the case i was just tossing the possibility out there if it is the case i am surprised your doctors havent looked into different studies because that is you know a pretty rare thing to become immune that fast
thank you so much for the advice im sorry for your losses i guess one of my problems is that in my journey of a thousand miles every time i take a step forward i seem to take two steps back i see everyone else around me practically sprinting to the finish and i still have yet to cross the starting line
i hate how everyone seems to have depression these days so when you actually have it people just expect you to get on with it just because they did when they were depressed
im not calling everything here bullshit but im really fucking tired of hearing oh itll get better or think of the people that love you aint none of those left im looking for a legitimate reason to not just say fuck it
you cant expect these changes to happen overnight this is a long term processi thought youve already been accepted you dont have a better self image after putting on muscle you dont feel good that youve changed your body for the better and accomplished something external changes dont happen until internal ones do
i can relate to this had a friend kill himself a few years ago was actually pretty good friends with him at one point but ive always been the person to just kinda disappear and be to myself where im at now and thinking about killing myself sometimes its like he lived walking distance from me and if i do it its gonna be like im copying him or something idk its just another part of the eternal battle
thats great that you went for help thats the first step and one of the hardest things to do i cant believe they turned you away maybe try calling them and setting up another appointment anyway in the meantime im here if you want to blow of some steam though you may feel hyperactive behavior it youre not alone im here
im sure that no ones lying to you a man i know just succeeded in committing suicide and i can assure you that he was a ghost of himself consumed by major mental depression for months everyone cares and everyone wishes he hadnt done it i hope you can find a way to carry on and i hope that if you give it some time you can find healing and happiness in your life
as a follow up to this where do i direct my fuck you if im homeless nobody will employ me ill be left with nothing but debt and a cardboard box douglass was able to start his movement because there were people out there that wanted to join his cause people that wanted to help him and others like him there were few but they were there now with my situation you know who wants to help me you know who wants to help a soontobe homeless man with debt out the ass not a damn person thats whonot to say that your post wasnt uplifting but he had people behind his cause i have nothing ive struggled with alcoholism with nobody even offering to help i pleaded for people to help me stop and nobody did not friends not family not counselors and at that time i still had some control over my life so i was able to say fuck you to that now ive lost that control and im still without the things i need all i need is a job that will let me work my ass off for food on the table but because of who i appear to be to complete strangers its assumed that i dont need it they all want to give the job to the older guy who has a family backing him up or the war vet who still has income trickling in if they really need it not the young guy looking to support himself ive killed my habits that seeked to kill me and ive done my best to better myself and its landed me up shit creek without even a boat let alone a paddle
its unfair that many people can just leave their beds wo problems it may seem like a miracle to you it sure does to me sometimes but everyones got special challenges in life and even those who jump our of bed wearing a bright smile each day might be confronted w difficulties once they enter a car make a cake or whatever even if not even if their life seems perfect they are bound to encounter some rocks on the road eventually so this is your challenge its one of the nastier ones no question about that but life functions tired strangely and so i think you should try to hold on try to take on day after another try to battle against all the rocks that are in your way i know its worth it and im pretty confident youll find out the same if you just hang in there
hihave you tried talking to a guidance counselor at your school or one of your teachers they could get you some of the help that you need
well the way i try to think about it is that there wouldnt be good people without assholes without assholes good people would just be people and without good people assholes would also simply be known as people i take solace in knowing that at the end of the day everything adds up to zero meaning that for every asshole out there there is someone whos as much of a good person as they are an asshole for every negative person theres a positive person of equal value
youre not an outsider youre just deeper in the valley than the rest of ushell matter to you until the end of your days if you give it a shot though youll discover that the world is full of people who will matter to you if you hate the stares you get why dont you take out the piercings wear a hat you never know change can be gooddo something for me tomorrow go out completely unchanged take a walk in the park or something for every weird look you get smile smile as big as you know how i guarantee you most people will smile backwe all feel like complete outsiders yet none of us are i feel you from all the way over here and i really wish you didnt pain so much if i could hug you i would
thank you as pathetic as it sounds i needed to hear that from someone from anyone
ive recently had a string of unfortunate freak accidents in the same vein the kicker was my bitchy dog pun intended as she was a lady died of bone cancer ive had her since i was itty bitty so i know that feeling doesnt help that it was preceded and proceded by a string of baby animals under my care dying sure the chances werent good to begin with but every little death has just chipped away at my soul since then my mother has a hobby farm and all i can see anymore is a bunch of things i love im going to have to watch dieas to your question criminal justice see clerks number for how that goes what were we trying to be batman the job market for the batman is understandably limited
im sure that anything i say will be mediocre at best butit will get better it hurts hyperactive behavior hell now but in time it will chest pain less he chest pain your heart and thats grievous but it will get better give yourself some time be gentle with yourself you say you have number more years to go if you find you really cant keep going to school ask about a postponement of school or something take some time off and go back when youre ready or take a vacation go home for a while you say you cant even kill yourselfthis is very natural it is a hard thing to do we are genetically programmed to want to survive and ache is unpleasant overall just be gentle with yourself and give yourself some time
i blame my isolation on being deaf and living among hearing people who dont understand the struggle thats why i crave internet i love not being left out
happy birthdayyou seem like such a caring person what are your hobbies
i went to one trial class that my friend gave me coupon for dude and just from that i met like number awesome energized friendly people who treated me like we were bros for months already that was back when i was suicidal i would go back in a second but i cant afford the numbermonth fee thoughbut since then ive developed this attitude that everything in my world i can control and change in a matter of minutes if i needed to and the past the past is behind me and never coming backand girls get hired so much faster than guys you dont even know you dont even need to be attractive
are you still there throwitallawaynumber i hope you are dont give up on yourself theres still something you can offer the world you just havent found it yet youre stuck wherever you are how about see the world through other peoples eyes
im sorry that your mom is so blind to a problem as severe as this but again talk to people that are willing to help you it can only do good
you just pointed out two options and then said that every path is hopeless what about thesewhat age are you if you are above the age of majority i can see no reason why you seeking out medical help yourself would be of detriment even in that environment youve already placed a target smack bang on your fathers head here i guess the question that you should ask yourself is are you considering suicide at least on some level as a way to get at your father and escape your misery all i am suggesting is you should consider the roots of this first you could be in a state now but if you go get your own help at the very least that sense of agency could help you out even if you do resolve for suicide later onthink for a second you are trapped and are considering the most exemplary option of agency selftermination as the option so it would be rather inconsequential but effective to do what you need to do and go sort out your own shit in spite of your father
actually i have found one talent in myself guitar coincidence much and the fear of death itself can be described hyperactive behavior so i wish i was dead but i dont want to diein a nutshell however if i had more simple methods of killing myself meds etc i really wouldnt mind just going for it hell if i already was on meds id certainly try to kill myself with them i probably wouldnt even be here right now
our situations are a little different but im also at a point that feels like rock bottom for me this is going to sound incredibly cliche but whats helping me get myself out of it is to try to do at least one thing to help myself and make my situation better every daysometimes i can have a normal productive happy day and thats great but right now i cant always do that i still try to get one thing done even if its small as long as im helping myself in some way it counts maybe i just show up to a class that i havent been to in a while maybe i clean my room maybe i just send an email that ive been needing to send anything as long as im doing something and then if i need to be i can be off the hook for the rest of the dayalso you said you fell in love with someone are you currently in a relationship or just interested in the person if youre in a relationship and youre both happy and feel the relationship is healthy dont automatically assume that you need to give it up if youre not in a relationship you might want to take some time to get yourself together but dont give up hopei started writing about my relationship but i decided not to talk about that yet in case youre not in a similar situation and itd make you feel worse id be happy to talk about it and how its a good thing for me if youd like though
this some of the smartest and welloff people didnt do well in school
i dont even know i am a performer at heart but i have never been able to make a living at it when i try to sell out i always get bored and end up getting fired recently i had success as a bartender but i quit for what ended up being stupid reasons so now i live on the other side of the country from where i was successful and i have to start from scratch againi started looking for a head doctor and the prices gave me a panic attack then i started looking for insurance so i could afford a head doctor and the premiums also gave me a panic attack
its not a viable option and youll be leaving your wife behind youd pain her beyond comprehensionit sucks worrying about money i know that first hand it can definitely feel hopeless as you seem to be tired aware of your wife might need to chip in financially i know time is an issue but even numbernumber hours a asthenia could alleviate a lot of the pressure in the meantime get your shit together write that resume tomorrow no excuses get it done and send it out whether you believe in some sort of powerful being or force governing things or not things really do work themselves out this is a big test for you and youll pull through just try to stay as positive as you can and everything will work out
ive asked for input because i have also experienced thisi have been depression for as far back as i can remember i have called suicide hotline plenty of times and landed myself in the hospital on four separate occasions over wanting to kill myself i have seen numerous psychologists psychiatrists and counselors and i still have never found any proper support a year ago my best friend decided to take number of her prescription pills in an attempt to kill herself and she ended up in the icu for days on end completely out of consciousness having thousands of seizures being in the hospital for a week after all of this occurred her own family wouldnt even show up to the hospital to show her any sort of support in fact they would call her yelling at her about her suicide attempt and she claims that they were upset that they would have to pay off all of her student loans for her if she were to have died they still call her every so often to basically tell her that she needs to help them pay off bills although she is an adult and has not lived with her parents for the past four yearsnone of our friends were tired supportive through either of our suicidal ideation all a person needs when they feel this way is compassion and understanding but im starting to believe that there is absolutely no love left in this world
and how does that make you feel depressed
well i wouldnt expect you to want to right now you still need to figure out what to do with your current relationship all im saying is once you make a decision keep an open mind thats the wonderful thing of love at numberst sight it just happens love is also something to look forward too just stay positive and look at all the things that are yet to come
ive played wow a lot and other games hyperactive behavior kerbal i dont play them that much anymore and i havent played the more realistic first person shooters mainly it just passes the timei listen to twitch in order just to hear talking plus the guy is playing mario games and such he talks and responds and i can even comment in the chat it is the closest ive had to a friend in years
you always can kill yourself later
im sorry to hear about the treatment youve received elsewhere but im hoping youll find those others were right to send you here it sounds like theres a lot on your plate right now and none of it is easy to bear especially when youre aloneall id like to know is why you think you cant speak to a counselorif its a financial issue most statesprovincescountries have workarounds programs or special services for those in needif its a perceived confidentiality issue educate yourself there are tired clear rules about what a counselor has to report and to whom it is reported so at least you can find out before trying outif its not either of those let me know ive had a lot of experience with counseling and therapy that has been tired positive for me and i think it could help you toojust my two cents please feel free to respond here or via pm or not at all if that makes you uncomfortable whatever helps you
whats been your most immersive book are you religious do you believe in more after death do you hope there isalso can you recommend one of purcells better works
they probably have college kids blowing off appointments all the time and thats why theyre so strict about it i wouldnt take it personally do you think you can make it until the numberth how are you doing
ive been depressed mood since at least age number maybe earlier thats the earliest i can remember flat out knowing that i was always sad and trying to end my lifeas to the restit depends there are times when i can think that i have worth even if its to others but i see no worth in myself and given everything i just feel utterly worthless objectively as well as subjectively
all right thenwhat exactly would make you happy dying is not an option presume youre annoyingly immortal what do you satisfy yourself withdouglas adams wrote about an immortal man in one of the hitchhikers books this man so annoyed with immortality tooled all around the universe insulting people in alphabetical order would that give you purposeyou are filled with selfhatred yet you are also filled with hatred for the rest of the world have you considered becoming a supervillainbecause in all honesty what i see is a lot of excuses as to why you cant change and why the rest of the world isnt worth your effort youre stuck in a rut and quite comfortable to sit there bitching about things
youre gonna have to get a new therapist you can try talking to people on url a lot of them have been where you are
never tried antidepressants only thing ive done is adderall and that was a few years ago

hi im in the same situation no family parents passed foster child no friends etc ill tell people this from time to time and they really dont get it if i kicked the bucket tomorrow there would be nobody at my funeralfor real just the hand i was dealt its so confusing and heartbreaking sometimes though one foot in front of the other until my day in the sun comes its strange not being connected to anyone at all be strong
hi sorry for the late response pc was malfunctioning ill attention deficit disorder him see if i get along with him i dont really have a favorite hero btw
i fake being an innocent and shy little person but in reality im just cold and bitter in side i just choose not to show it
dont do it it wont solve anything wouldnt you rather be able to look back and say i did it i stuck through and survived instead of having a tombstone say rest in peace and you even think about saying no one would care if i die well youre wrong because i just read your submit and well i care keep fighting through your classes and fuck the people who say being a writereditor isnt a real job those people are needed in almost every line of business you would be an important person in society for those skills other words things would get published and have errors and then people would get confused and would be lost being an editor is line being a lighthouse on a dark rainy night finding a job is hard though yes and for that im sorry i dont know were to begin to help but dont kill yourself that would be terrible keep hope and love in your heart do things that make you happy and for your own sake you should really think about moving at least to a nicer place in town if such a thing exists if you need someone to talk to you can message me you want just dont give up
i understand what its like to feel like that and how much doubt not knowing what to do because you barely enjoy anything anymore can create from my understanding of things a renewed purpose in life should bring things back to normal though that isnt that easy a thing approaching your days by trying to get the most out of each hour or so could help as long as youre kept busy by interesting things things should feel alive id recommend trying to bring as much as you can of the happy activities into the other onesits a different problem but my room is the only place where i feel that i can truly relax and ive found that as long as i have my ipod and my headphones i can keep that sense of security going in triggery situations because i know that if things became too much i could just plug in to the right playlist and feel alrightusing the energy that you can find to keep doing at least one that that you find interesting andor like doing should have a snowballing effect suicide certainly isnt the answer here because its possible for thing to get better ive been suicidal for number days now and its often on my mind but i do what i need to do to get through the day and enjoy what i can id recommend trying to identify everything that still feels normal and trying to extend them as much as possible and contacting a suicide hotline if things become really hard
thank you
inspiration was what i hoped for thank you
but i dont know how to depend on people isnt that how you survive in the real world i hate revealing parts of myself and asking for help i much rather die than hand out resumes to random strangers and become vulnerable to anyone i want people to leave me alone i just dont see myself capable of functioning in this i have hobbies but whats the point of them you would just do them for yourself and i feel incredibly guilty whenever i do anything for myself not to mention this hopeless mental depression and perfectionism which seems to make it pointless
man once you start opening up saying what youre really thinking to people who are in a similar boat its hard to stop theres definitely that rush of excitement and hope i enjoyed experiencing that through your writingexercise number helps all the time trouble for everyone is sticking to it for more than a monthhave you taken any rec drugs taking lsdacid has helped me an experience i would severely recommend everyone experiences before they die getting drug abuse when im feeling abnormally stress also helpsurl i asked someone else earlier to look at this this guy helps me see how unique and abnormal behavior life is when im feeling meaninglesson a final note you are completely tied down to your responsibility to your pup she needs somewhere to live and someone to love her
i love you and i hope you make the right decisionlife i guarantee you will find something worth living for in a matter of time and at least you could get a pet puppy or something like that someone that needs you as much as the people you dont even realize that need you if you ever need someone to talk to or rant to feel free to message me im not some kind of psychiatrist but i do care more than you know
i can almost physically feel the pain in your writing i dont know you but i want you to know that youre worthwhile that you deserve to be here and even though you dont know it you make the world a better place by being here as you read that i know you dont believe it hell youd feel really guilty even if you tried to believe it but its true it really is true
how did you end up in such an isolated location you make it sound hyperactive behavior your in one of those old numbers scientific huts they set up in the arctic to study ice or blistering cold wind you did say up here sounds hyperactive behavior at one point you were not so isolated a new job in a new cityi cant agree that youre a fuck up if you have you own place although isolated and surrounded by ice and snow and also net access seems hyperactive behavior youve done some things right i wish i could never celebrate another birthday personally if you have no reference in time to mark against yourself or you dont have birthdays could you live younger and longer if you arent any older science should find out and just prove birthdays are bad for you once and for all so i can have an easier time getting out of them if you didnt knowforgotten your birthday and someone asked you how old you were youd say i dunno its up to your mind to be however old you think you might be but if you know beyond any doubt your number for example youll try and force yourself to be number its tough to talk about life everyone has their own thoughts on it philosophy i guess is the word recently and ive thought about this topic for over number decades i have to ask myself why we have to label points on everything if grass grows out in a meadow where nothing will ever eat it its still grass it exists not everything has to be overly analyzed and given purpose and point and significance like interpreting dreams its a waste of everyones time that said i think its different individually some people give themselves a point to existing and try to better society invent computers and tablets and airplanes other people will type on a computer maybe use a tablet and perhaps fly on an airplane some day some people will make a difference in the majorities mind others will sit at home all day and get drug abuse the point is points are trivial they matter only as much as they matter on an individual basis its devoting importance to something that questionably doesnt need none like human sacrificing atop drug abuse temples to make the sun rise or the crops grow thats why this is one of those topics that weve been blabbering on through out human history its obvious if no conclusion has been made by now there is no right answer to life you could simply simplify everything and just try to be happy easier on paper not always in practice i dont have to invent some world ending bomb space travel super engines whatever just be happy in the pursuit of happiness some days youll break even between sad and happy most moments might be sad but if zombieland teaches anything its the small things that matter the small things that make all the difference
i have friends that want me to come out and do stuff but i just cant it just sucks
hello how are you doing shawshenkhave things changed at all
maybe you should let your family and friends know reach out to those around you ive been there where you want to die but everythings fine so i know where youre coming from
i didnt come out of my room except to get deliveries at the door so much schoolwork piled up for tomorrow yet i didnt lift a finger to do any of it idk just stayed in bed slept numberh overall and listened to really loud musicwhat about you
pretty sure weve dated in the past when i read your screed what i see most of all is the word i it is abundantly clear to me that the only thing you have to focus on is yourself and you hate this with an unbridled passion yet you turn deeper inward which makes you hate morewhat have you done to make the world a better place latelywhom have you helpedhow have you changed your environment for the betterment of those who come after youyou speak of patients im guessing your ability to improve the livelihood of those you work with professionally is being hampered by your inner experience and this isnt helping your wellbeing either its time to reset the clocktake a working vacation plant trees for a asthenia join the peace corps do something wherein you are out of your comfort zone doing things you dont know how to do for people you do not know ctrlaltdelete your daytoday and see what changes it seems like you have nothing to lose
well the entire world cant loathe your existence because i certainly dont
rather than going way i found it just becomesnormal i cant remember what being happy is even hyperactive behavior any more just get sort of numbness to the effects at the end of the day i suppose
this thank you for this there will come a day when i too will not have ache it can take a while but i should always follow the light at the end of the tunnel until ive reached it
where to begincompared to my brother my mom blames me for everything keep in mind im in college and almost done he is a felon that does nothing with his life but i guess where the heart is for her my dad honestly just doesnt seem to care to step in and tell her to knock it offrelationships i have been with number guys total and always get pain current bf never talks to me i maybe see him every numbernumber weeks he reads my messages but never responds so yet again proving that dating i am worthlessschool is the only thing i have going for me but even with a year left i am just donework is the same worthless feeling i do so much but nothing gets seen or appreciated so i feel worthless i have bipolar depression and gad i cut myself already summed up version i guess
i read your story and honestly i could have written it nearly word for word several car accidents that should have been the death of me over a years time sexually abused by my own father debt up to my eyeballs from medicalschooleveryone holding their hands out gimme gimme gimme god the break ups people who you love who should be there for you after youve stood by their side through it all yeah its tough its enough to break some people but youre still here youre not broken it feels hyperactive behavior it it feels hyperactive behavior the world couldnt shit on you anymore than it already has right well im not going to lie it probably can the thing is there are people who actually do care we want you to get better we want to be your friend we want to be here for you and listen whenever you need to talk vent laugh whatever you want a bright side its getting up everyday putting on your clothes and telling the world to bring it because you can take whatever it throws at you and youll come out stronger because of it youve already been through all of that and survived youre a survivor im always around if you need someone to talk to feel free
feeling much better today i just hate when you never know when the suicidal thoughts are coming
you cant show them theres nothing to show you can tell them and explain why you see the need to do it to move out explain them this shouldnt affect your friendship as friends they should understand your needs and put them ahead of that need to live all together and party everynight if they cant see it its their loss
because if she is willing to do that then she will be nothing but trouble for any guy she is with you deserve a great woman she tricked you into thinking that was what she is but she is not worth an ounce of your love take some time to cool down and try to be logical you have the chance to be a great guy for a woman who will truly appreciate youso dont end your life because of someone who lost you someone who is obviously extremely disgusting think of yourself as lucky that youre never going to have to live with a a person truly that despicable you and her being together wouldnt have made her any better of a person if shes going to do something hyperactive behavior this now she wouldve always been this horrible and be thankful you have the opportunity to give your love and compassion to a woman who truly deserve you and more important you deserveany person who goes this far in order to make another person upset isnt a person youd want to spend your life with trust metake care my friend
please go back to her you need to have a helping hand were here to listen but professional help in person is probably going to be better for you or you can try both feel free to write any time to let me know whats happening im interested and care
you should post this word for word on rmensrights and attention deficit disorder how you want to fight back or whatever you want to do i guarantee you that you will be able to find a ton of support there dont let them win you need to either fight back or start over somewhere else either way post this to rmensrights it will become a top post in an active community sized numbernumber people they will fight for you ask them how you want them support you
you have heard the saying that on planes that you put the oxygen mask on yourself first so you are able to put the oxygen mask on your childthere is a repeating theme in your short paragraph that you dont want to bother anybody but what exactly do you think committing suicide would do i dont want to bother my therapist this early or at all i can assure you that if you are getting to the edge of the cliff she wouldnt care if you called at numbernumber amyou really need to work on your codependency issues and then the rest will follow i cant tell anyone how low i feelyes you can you just listed excuses insteadstop avoiding your problems and anxiety and start addressing them if you dont want to be a burden i hate that women are conditioned to feel this way then the best thing you can do is to actively seek help and talk to your husband and go to the hospital if you need too
first never apologize for venting we all need to vent look at this way suicide and thoughts as such are not an easy thing to deal with and no matter what life brings you in the future good or bad remember that you are stronger than you think tonight you faced a true monster head on and won sometimes it really just all is relative so to speak and if you ever want to talk or anything i can help with inbox is open no judgement
please seek help i know its cliche but we all need our support system and with your mother gone you need to build a new support system and seeking help can really solve that problem
im sorry for venting in such a negative attitude its just all running through my head i cant get it past me
i just dont know anymore tbh i dont want to live here i think im going to call the police tonight or run away

sounds like your other half really wants to be part of your life no one is beyond saving but you have to help yourself which means you need to talk to a medical professional just cause you push people away doesnt mean they wont come back but by the sounds of it the first step is addressing what is going on with you
i just want some peace i cant stop crying i just want to die
you just got a breathe slow down your girl left but your heart is still beating time is the only thing that can heal this you got a promotion your company values you the work load may be hard but they believe in you this shows that your skills have been noticed they wouldnt have given you this job had they thought you couldnt do it dont let them down we cant choose family but we dont have to let that family run our lives if they dont hyperactive behavior something you did or dont notice you then why have them in your life make a choice thats best for you this medical condition isnt your fault its a sickness sicknesses either pass in time or you learn to live with them quitting because you look bad isnt honorable do something to change it make something else stand out more than what you think looks bad you should hold on because this is the life we get make the most of this
rrapecounseling is a good sub i know how you feel i plotted the murder of my abuser every day until he finally killed himself id go so far as to say its a relatively normal feeling either way maybe a therapist could help you sometimes just talking things out getting those feeling out there can make you feel so much better it gets some of the venom out
im much younger than you but please dont kill yourself you have so many good qualities why let them go to waste sex doesnt matter you are a beautiful person despite what others think
go for the divorce its reversible
it depends on whether or not i want to stay depressed mood at the timeif im really super down and dont particularly feel hyperactive behavior getting up yet ill often put on tools undertow isis panopticon and primordials to the nameless dead and other music that follws in that same sort of direction sorrowful somewhat slow metalif i want to actually be useful i find the most abrasive energetic music i can stuff hyperactive behavior skeletonwitch between the buried and me sikth and dillinger escape plan are good for this
can i ask why you want to do this
do you know what death is like every time i feel like ending it ill imagine a true hell being stuck in my body i imagine after my heart stops and brain ceases to function being able to see my dead body i imagine seeing my family discovering my dead body what if thats what awaits you when you kill yourself death may actually be worse than being alive
its terrible losing a friend and im sorry you have to deal with that and the pressure as well but i think you have a lot of lovedid you ever talk to your friends mom or your mom or anyone about how you feel bipolar mental depression can be awful i understand feeling hyperactive behavior it will never get better but talking helps finding a connection helps beating against the sad mood hyperactive behavior youve done posting here tonight is the best thing you can doif youre feeling lonely please reach out falling into yourself is never the answer
well good luck to you and ty for the advice
in a sense what youre recommending is in line with what someone else recommended change i wonder how far ill need to change in order to find peace from this whether ill need to become an entirely different person i suppose if im ready to walk away from life it doesnt matter does it either way i die in some senseif you met me in real life youd find me far less interesting and i expect youd be far less willing to give me the benefit of the doubt with regards to my personalitydue to tired personal reasons along with my general lack of social skills finding love is impossible for me which is one major part of the problem its not just me feeling sad and not wanting to put effort into it its essentially impossible ive been trying to grapple with the idea of spending the rest of my days alone for over a year now and its been one of the hardest things to get to grip with i dont think ill ever get comfortable with the ideabut then maybe i can change into a different person and distract myself until i die alone of malignant neoplastic disease at number
i play video games i do some writing i talk to my friends on skype i might go for a bike ride but when im angry or sad i usually just curl up in my basement and cry
i cant really provide much insight but if you want to join the military i vote navy navy is cushy in that youre always in the same bed you have a floating kitchen and hospital always on hand and the bigger the boat the less the seasickness
okay i strongly suggest that you find a psychiatrist you need an expert in mental health not a general practitioner what is it that you feel you have to hide how old are you as for the asshole at school could you tell me a little more about the situation
that sounds cool learning multiple programming languages has to count for something probably doesnt seem hyperactive behavior much considering youre not making a decent living with it but it is something i tried to teach myself python or at least familiarize myself with it but it just seemed so foreign to me and of course i didnt stick with it is there any specific reason you dropped out of college
i dont even know how to imagine what you must be going through but i do know that the first thing you did right today was getting on here and asking to talk to someone congrats because you just made new friends who are willing to listen and you get through
you assume youve caused your boyfriends depression but youre not sure you should ask him to be surenever feel bad about things other people have done to help you its their decision let them make it and say fuck them if they regret it or are mad about it because seriously fuck themyou resent your father for not being there and you want to know why im just going to guess that the reason doesnt have to do with you personally he probably just didnt want a kid any kid i know its hard not to take it personallyits possible that all of your interpersonal struggles stem from the fact that you are too focused on yourself and you think other peoples moods and actions are more influenced by you than they actually are youre plodding through college and not enjoying yourself you should ask yourself if youre getting anywhere if a logical next step is in place for after you graduate hopefully you arent wasting your time dont worry if youre wasting anyone elses time just ask am i moving toward a goal right now and then do i really want that goal ask that all the time college is a good opportunity if your goal is to be a normal successful person being a normal successful person isnt everything its two things three if you count being a person as a thing
honestly from what im assuming youre not happy find something that makes you happythis might be a terrible example but its the only one i know think of kurt cobain he started heroine to stop his depression but once he stopped not to promote drugs but you need to find something that keeps you happy if youre done school go find a place somewhere hyperactive behavior japan france ireland etc to start fresh meet new people have fun
im sorry you feel this way its not a great way to feel whenever i feel this way i try to step out of my comfort zone by doing something different such as getting a tattoo not always the smartest or spoiling myself by buying something ive been wanting or reaching out this is always really hard for me to do maybe for you to feel alive you could try something new maybe go for a run outside or pick up a new hobby painting is super relaxing
i have nothing thats why im here ive lurked on sw for months now i knew it was my turn to reach out because i have nothing else
ive tried my best to stay strong for too long but i cant do it any more every now and then im having this wish to die and end it all
right now im scared im worried my girlfriendbest friend will leave because im having a hard time managing my shit even though she hasnt given me reason to think shell leave the pills arent working like they did eitherim angry at my ex for emotionally abusing me and im pissed off that she doesnt feel guilty about what it did to me the year of alcoholism and the severe depression and the neverending anxiety and the nearsuicidebut whatever i feel im still breathingi guess that counts for something doesnt it
i know even they will understand i mustered up every ounce of strength i had today and it was all for nothing just to fail for the last time
ah yes i misunderstood your intentions absolutely
hi are you ok today do you want to talk about things
if you are having concerns you absolutely consult a professional
why do you think that might be i guess this is what everybodyd say but dont you think theres something you could do about it would you like to discuss all this over pms its okay if you dont want to reply or anything i understand answering these kind of questions is not fun ive been through all of it
umm how should i put it family is the major reason of my mental depression
maybe the therapist is doing some good at some level even if theyre just telling you stuff which seems obvious or not helpful you do need to have someone to talk to as friends and family can probably only help so muchlosing someone slowly or suddenly both must be incredibly pain in your case you wrote that he would be angry that it was sudden and that you were there when it happened while theres no way i can guess what he was thinking i know that although i wouldnt want to put my wife and kids through that theres also no one else id rather have to keep me company for that inevitable experience the terrible on a personal level truth for me and my family is that death will come to me too and the better relationship i have with my wife and children the more pain it will be i can only hope that its a long way in the future and we have a lot more fun first as a dadhusband i try my best to make the time with them as good as possible even the knowledge that it will be pain in the end to take away possible pain from when i do go it would be best just to slowly withdraw barely see them and ruin the relationshipim quite obviously not trained in any of this but when i go i want my wife and kids to remember the good times as youre doing with the slideshow presentation in your head id be urging them to please not hurt even though its impossible not to people say that the pain never really goes away and i suppose thats normal youve lost something but as a dad id want the pain memories to be overridden eventually by the happy ones and would hope that its possible for that to happen within a reasonable amount of time which i suppose is the grieving process as he was an exceptionally good dad that makes the pain worse in exchange only for him having had a great time with you and seeing you grow up and have a kiddy of your own he would have loved every second of it believe me perhaps that was one of his last thoughts as a dad id be thinking well this is shit no regrets though lovely daughter family etc love them
we used not to we used to be really close its been rocky for the past number weeks thats it before that its all good idk if you read the whole thing in detail but she told me all that harsh shit because shes anger at the fact i denied i denied because i dont remember i hope she doesnt think im living giving her time to cool down has always worked but hyperactive behavior i said never has she seemed this pissed sure shes called me an ass in the past sure shes told me to leave her alone but during our whole number yrs of knowing each other has she ever told me that i was dead to her or stay out of her life
if she knew how broken you were now she would be devastated
ha cool i didnt irritable mood swimming in specific although that would be cool just offering anecdotal evidence about how a few basic certs might really help your job search yeah keeping reading at least a bit seems hyperactive behavior it would help a lot maybe try writing a bit on the web you know rwritingprompts or do some webfiction might not be making a living off of it might not be making money but id imagine validation would be useful right anyways i need to go to bed ill check this again tomorrow im just a twobit moron but if you ever need anyone to just talk to go ahead and shoot me a pm ill try to answer asap
so many people think that admitting that youre suffering is showing weakness its not its showing strength were fighting a terrible monster and defeating that monster is one of the strongest things we can do
you will always come back so much stronger afterwards ive been cheated on in at least one or two long term relationships sometimes i dont know if the girl was faithful in one of the relationships i digress it is extremely painful you will suffer for months on end but when you come out of it you will be better than you were before hardened by fire then you will meet somebody worth your time the person im going out with now is the best person ive ever gone out with by far the experience will prove that you are worth someone who is loyal and awesome
welcome to the rollercoaster when i get better i often forget how bad the bad days were and it totally hits me by surprise when im back there its completely natural to be distrusting of people when you have these symptoms i wonder whether with a bit of thought youd be able to take the leap and try see if shes able to help otherwise have you perhaps searched for mental health resources in your area there may be nonprofit organisations with information andor services relevant to your situation the most important thing though is to remember that this is something thats affecting you but its not who you are its not a character flaw and its something that can get better
i understand the logic of waiting till you have the resources its what i tell myself as well but i wonder living this kind of destructive life will we ever have those resources before we get out your mom mine corrodes every little bit of good you manage to build up for every hour your therapist gets to build you up she gets number to tear you down the money and job will you be able to get something good enough anyway while youre stewing in misery you could just walk away live out of a car and flip burgers until you found what youre looking for seems much less comfortable but it might also be much less likely to make you want to kill yourself i spend so much time telling myself i just need to get things in order so that i wont fail when i finally try but i wonder if thats just a way of procrastinating and keeping myself from doing what i fear i wonder if eventually we just have to jump without a parachute anyway
there is nothing that cannot be forgiven you have to forgive yourself first and foremost because she might not thats ultimately her problem and not a reason to end your lifeif you give it some time she may come around i suggest trying to talk and apologize in person its tired difficult to reject someone right to their face as opposed to over text
i know it can be devastating to lose someone who has come to define you you can find yourself ripped apart but maybe thats also a chance to reform yourself start at the base and rebuild you dont have to annihilate yourselfif you look at your words youll notice youre pretty ambiguous you think you might suicide is not the kind of decision for ambiguity although this is very common but it is the one decision in life that really demands an im definitely doing this and i know deep down in the depth of my being its absolutely what i want to do because theres no going back most of the time we find we are not that determined that really its not annihilating ourselves were craving but simply to destroy our old lives and start again as in we confuse wanting to kill ourselves with wanting to kill life itself it is possible to reconstruct yourself and start over without ending everything
maybe those things became less interesting maybe you should make plans that are very specific instead of seeing the world or traveling to africa chose where in africa and make a plan to do it
i love dancing around naked while i wait till everything dries what kind of music do you like
i think if you make it clear that youre worried about getting to that place rather than being in that place you shouldnt have to anxiety about going to a hospital and if you are in that place then a hospital and being surrounded by people who are trying to help you is not a bad situation to be in or at least its a better situation than you could be in enjoy your book and when youre done or you get bored dont dissapear inside your head again do something else its a pleasure
i appreciate your perspective i suppose my perspective might be appropriate for you that is not only a temporary solution it may actually come back to hit you hard later on i dont know you and i dont know your life but if you can be that way without something hanging over you constantly try a little more compassion in exchange for selfishness you can give yourself scars keeping up that approach for too long and that is what i allude to in my post why do i say this because i tried a similar tactic for a long time and should have seen the problem with it i may not be here in a year or two but take it from me that shit can be a killer yet you can live with your problem i could too for a time maybe if something doesnt wait around your corner you can keep doing that
dude i do the same thing it makes reading comprehension much easier im in my late numbers so there was no adhd ocd diagnoses when i was a kid it was you were bad a spaz too much sugar etc its just a part of what makes me up but i dont let it run my life
unfortunately ive had a bad experience with telling any kind of friend be it close friend or just you know a friend coworker about what happens i find that it makes them upset and eventually they leaveall it takes is two people to do that and i feel uncomfortable saying anything because i dont want to be a burden on the friend and i dont want them to have to try to fix me in some way i lost my closest friend in college because of that she felt that if i went to church more everything would be better i appreciate you taking the time to listen to me it makes a difference and thank you the promotion is huge and should be a joyous occasion being bipolar disorder sucks its a new diagnosis so im not quite straightened out yet
go and get yourself some hobbies join any club that is cheap or for free good way to get to know people and to get to know girls worked for me
reposting this here so you see itthis i lived this tired situation for three years no matter what they say they will do no matter the promises they make it will not get better i was pregnant and scared i had no friends never left our apartment i had no support system i understand loving him and wanting to make it work it wont though i had no education and didnt think i could leave i finally did though after he sexually assaulted me early one morning and it was the best thing i have ever done for myself and my kids its hard being alone and making it on my own but it is so much better than being controlled or manipulated like i wasim going to pm you my story hopefully it will help you some
so lets say that its possible to reprogram your brain but not to give you a different one would that be something you could possibly consider
so what things have changed was the weekend good enough to postpone suicideim sorry ive been afk i had to go home and deal with somethings i hope your weekend went well man keep fighting once the major stressors are gone im sure youll feel a bit better
my internal philosophy is really fucked up i either live an original productive life or nothing i am nausea of failure im nausea of being a parasite i feel so weak its hard for me to describe all these years ive dogged on myself and abused myself through harsh selftalk and its all coming out thank you
thank you its nice to know that a total stranger believes i have worth its motivating and refreshing to think that i have plenty of chances to find happiness its just so often that the depression has me in a slump where i dont feel like doing anything but still thank you so much for taking the time to encourage
hi friend im sorry you feel this way i know you must be hurting a lot right now but please just breathe and think you are beautifully made its hard to believe it a lot of us struggle with it so please know youre not alone you are important and most definitely worthy of help i think its really great of you to reach out and tell us about it

no one gives a single shitthat is factually incorrect we are a bunch of internet strangers who have nothing to gain by giving a shit about you yet we do if there are people hyperactive behavior us that give a shit while getting nothing in return then it logically follows that in the number billion people that walk around this earth there must be many people who will want to be your loyal friend in a mutually beneficial relationship i too hated numbernumber of people on this earth including my parents and you know what i still fucking do but instead of killing myself i based off of this rational construction above realized there must be people hyperactive behavior me and i joined mensa where i met a lot of people who had similar experiences and extreme standards for loyalty as well if you family hates you then fuck them there are literally billions of other people in which there has to be at least numbernumbernumbernumber that you will be able to get a long with you just have to be almost entrepeneurial about it to find them you are stuck in thinking you have to live with the people you have been dealth with or with those that you have come across accidentally in your life but the people that can make you happier are out there somewhere
that idea helped me to go through some tough periods in my life i am not a dick and i am almost isolated from the society already thanks for that
wow thats really bad i was thinking that the professionals would be able to say something useful i havent had that much experience with any online therapy resources but i could look around im not sure what other offical resources there arecan you go to the hospital again if you need tofamily stuff can be really hard various events have left me with selective mutism so i find communicating with my family really difficult which they dont really understanddo you know if theres any way that you could access some form of free therapy the waiting lists are usually months long but i suppose its something to have in the worksmy general approach is to try and distract and immerse myself in as much as possible books games films shows music im usually multitasking them anything to make it through the day ive now had suicidal thoughts for number days im not sure how helpful the more specific advice that i could give would be just whatever it takes to lessen the pain and survive the dayhug
people break up you are dealing with being sober dont apologize and for goodness sake stop with the facebook already
please look at the post i just wroteurl like you i was a teenage girl with a great life supportive family caring friends good grades promising future and was still depression and suicidal now im neither depression nor suicidal and im grateful every day that i didnt kill myself a few years ago when it seemed like the only optionyou say your ocd and anxiety are selfdiagnosed have you told anyone about your problems it was pain and difficult for me to do that but its necessary please seek help
i think there is a lot in this book that would benefit you url
like i said no making money on own due to the fact there is no proving that my work is legit in order to be self employeed i need to be licensed or incorporated or i have to wait til the number years is upnumber years from now ill be way to old to go anywhere im number now at the age of number ill be pratically ancient too late to go anywhere
you sound like a therapist haha in a good way though not the domineering iknowmorethanyou way you articulate tired well and your comment really impacted me seriously thank you so much im guessing you understand and relate to others fairly well as you seemed to really get me after just reading my post thank you for mentioning my good qualities its rare that strangers genuinely care for other humans in my experience ive always tried my hardest for others to feel appreciated so for me to get something like your message back is so nicei think finding a person besides my parents to talk to will definitely help my therapist now i only see for half an hour every two weeks and that just isnt enough so im in search for someone ill see weekly its extremely hard for me to share my suicidal thoughts with anybody i view the depression and ideations as a downfall something to be embarrassed of as my parents have never been big feeling sharers so im ashamed in admitting these feelings with friends or therapists
a few reasons i feel backed into a corner mostly and im tired of being tired of everything if that makes sense
ha never thought id be offering words of wisdom hey if you ever need someone to talk to you can just shoot me a pm im no professional or anything but it might help just to talk right

from my experience when people tell you you are a genius they mean it because it makes them feel stupid when they dofrom what you say it sounds like you really like to innovate create new and useful things i can totally get how it feels like a renaissance there is so much potential in all the knowledge we have it seems like so much could be achieved by just combining the two right fields

you meant you grew up i kinda also felt the same i remember sometimes i would sit in a corner all night in complete darkness reminiscing the point of it all there was a dumb sense of superiority in that i was the one who saw the truth and everyone else was blind that i could fool everyone into thinking that everything was fine and dandy i honestly had nothing going on for me back then i wont go into too much detail because it was still not that far back and i dont want to go back into that mindset i still run away from it i had made a promise to me back then i feel really scary shivers as i write this because i still vividly remember it it was a bad time for me but hey time that promise has long since past actually a few days back i turned number so just over a year actually im really glad i found a point to it all im glad it broke that promise i even look forward to the future now i honestly dont even know how it happened because i also felt hyperactive behavior you there was no point in anything and there wasnt even a single thing in this life that i found interesting or that i was passionate about i dont want to ramble on and on so ill just say it i found a dream one for me i know it sounds kind of silly but that silly and impossible dream really is what keeps me going it makes want to become a better a better person actually i have improve or else i wont ever reach it i want to reach so badly so badly i have never wanted anything so more with my heart that it i guess thats what normal people feel about life by default right im jealous slowly the bad thought will fade away not completely but they become manageable im happy now well not always you will always have to fight against that thing inside of you but i think im stronger now i feel hyperactive behavior when i smile i really irritable mood itmaybe that will work for you too just hang on a little longer thats why i did and it worked out it really did i irritable mood fuck man younger me scares me im lucky enought to have evidence of it a journal my father gave to me when i was a child i never really got into it but ever off year or so i would write something and every now and then i read that entry i wrote when i was going through that its hard to face that that was actually me hang on a little more maybe youll surprise yourself hyperactive behavior i did
thanks but i just cant i really try to accept your help this is why i posted my story but i am sitting in front of a table made ready for two now it didnt came to my mind that i did that a huge throwback nowi am really trying to adjust but everything i do seems to make it worse
youre right i have almost no trust in myself and if i tried to write to my friends itd be a lot longer than the post i wrote here to explain all the events of the last half a year i know im trying to find excuses not to talk to them and the list of excuses is growing less but i also have a phobia of checking my emails or texti havent even checked my personal emails since late sept
hey there i just want to remind you that this does not have to be the end of your story things seem depressed mood right now for sure but its important that you dont give up right now you can relaunch your life as many times as you want move away get a new job etc but you can only end it oncei think you should talk to your so about what youve been feeling lately if she is a huge reason for whats ventricular dysfunction left of your happiness its your responsibility to let her be involved with your thoughts and feelingsthis isnt the end buddy its just another beginning
i just searched reddit for forever alone because thats how i feel maybe sharing my story will helpive been feeling really alone at college lately and have gone out just once this entire semester i forced myself to contact someone tonight and he told me to meet him and his friends at a frat house at number i showered put on makeup got all dressed up and headed over there i texted my friend and got no response i went inside asked around couldnt find him there was barely anyone there and the few who were were all freshmen i left still hoping to get a response i drove to the bar where a lot of people hang out but it looked pretty deserted so i didnt go in theres number hour grocery store around the corner so i went in and picked up milk and candy for trickortreaters forever alonebut guess what tonight were alone together
i do the exact same thing sometimes when i mess something up even if its just the smallest mistake you can think of i insult myself and remember it for months telling myself how stupid i was every now and then it makes many people mad which it shouldnt ive tried to avoid it but i feel even worse if i just shut up and dont say anything ive learnt to cope with it i guess sorry i dont have any advice for you i just think id tell you youre not alone out there
i feel were at two conflicting points here i wasnt advocating you to get fat just more so to live care free and if you get fat then oh well the exercise didnt help you be happy im not sure what you want to hear but i hope you find a way to see the beauty in the darkness of life
aannnnnnnd i failed again apparently pills just cause stomach muscle cramp and common cold chills

hey i dont know much im going to try to talk though okayit sounds hyperactive behavior youre tired upset at the breakup and how its chest pain you it sounds hyperactive behavior you want to have one last shot at feeling good have you thought about waiting not on the pismo beach but on staking so much in it theres a lot at pismo beach but its not everything its only a few dozen square miles in this massive massive world
thank you but i cant bare to leave my mother in this state i clean the house cook for her and take care of my little brother if i leave she would have to get up and she dosnt have much strength she dosnt hyperactive behavior leaving the house ether because people stare at her as well
im not going to lie it can hard to be with someone dealing with depression i have a new level of respect for my so for being able to handle it
thats super tough man im number and what seems hyperactive behavior the exact situation number years prior to yours ive thought about and dreaded being where you are and what ive come up with isyou will have to get a depressed mood supermarket job or something to make money to afford to retake your entire degree which i guess is restarting it when youre hyperactive behavior number and youll have to keep your knowledge touched up over the few years socially you will probably lose your uni friends and make a couple new ones at your next jobits honestly not the worst prospect and your parents will more easily come to terms with you being a dropout whos going to try harder than you killing yourself after faking your last number years
yeah ive tried healthy dieting its actually how my disorder started c i realized that if i ate even less and exercised even more i could lose weight faster then when i ate too much i decided i could just throw it up then the binges started ugh pro tip dont develop an eating disorder they suck
thanks so much for responding while i do think the hospital isnt the right place for me it has gotten me connected more quickly with therapy groups and the hyperactive behavior which is a good thing i suppose i just feel hyperactive behavior being there is a complete waste of time though especially when it makes me miss my job my main thing with hospitals i guess is i go in and tell them i feel entirely powerless so they stick me in a hospital gown take away everything except maybe a book and for all intents and purposes show me what its really hyperactive behavior to be powerless ive been around that block a few times though and know what to avoid saying if i want to stay out of the hospitaland no i havent heard of dbt ive dabbled in cbt a bit but i hate it mainly because there are right answers to all the questions im willing to give pretty much anything a shot ill look into it
no you have a good point there are seven billion people in this world we you and me were nothing compared to the whole but have you tried looking at it this way theres number billion people on this world and only a few hundred make any real impact the rest of us are ventricular dysfunction left to figure out our own place in this world man i know it sucks to have your own perceptions turn against you its happened a few times to me and theres nothing i fear more but hell disorders hell they suck but they irritable mood that your problems are legitimatei cant offer you much but hey ill be your support ill talk to you just shoot me a pm in the meantime though well if youre up to it if you can maybe think about trying and getting out meeting people sure most people might be self interested but i believe youll find a person or two to be a support net
what makes you depressedi cant help you unless i understand youdescribing ways to kill yourself doesnt help us help you
roy is kinda useless unless you give hem exp priority which is rather impossible from chapter number onward imo also i have a ww link plush hahaanyway i dont really know i think its just something that comes and goes it started about numbernumber years ago though i think by the way since we are so offtopic lets pm haha
im all ears whats your life likehave you got a history of depression is this the first time youve thought about killing yourselfjust let it all out
im here
i like you i really want to help people but i have so many problems its so hard to keep going sometimes im waiting to seek therapy i just got approved for medicaid im in the us im unemployed and a full time student right now so but the medicaid doesnt start until may numberst so ill have to stick it out until then ive always struggled with depression but i dont like the idea of taking medication thank you so much for your kindness i hope i can save many lives one day thats my dream is to protect people
well i enjoy my job more than the previous one but i think its just the shiny new object feeling thats gone from it i work as a middlemanager supervising a number man team wont say more than that i had to fire a guy a few weeks ago he worked there for a long time but he basically did a lot of stupidity over the past few months that lets just say warrants him being let go my boss said that as rare as it is to have to fire someone its the toughest part of the job and he feels pain whenever he has to do it he said that i handled it really well and professionally i know deep down i didnt feel a thing about telling him he was terminated and that he wont be compensated by unemployment which is why i was able to handle it professionally ive talked to a therapist a few years ago when things really went to hell she basically said she couldnt help me granted it was to deal with a shiny new divorce and not about suicide i feel safer talking on a tor browser than walking into a therapists office and telling himher basically what i just posted the last thing i want is my ex finding out and using it as a reason to take custody of my kid then my decision to go through with it will be made my problem is that there are times where i really feel like killing myself and i just get really moody about it but then i somehow manage to shake it off after awhile and just keep going on with my life it could be something as simple as me waking up and thinking to myself i should die and then theres times where i sit in a corner of my room and really think about how shitty my life is for the next few hours i literally go through my memories with a fine comb and think about every decision i have made which was wrong and think about every time i fucked up and that i am just a dumb jackass who should really off myself
no probso if you dont mind me asking whats got you so down
hey are you still there man can we talk
ive had two psychotherapists one doctor and i talk to my parents all the time about it i dont know why they arent helping im only fifteen so i really dont know whats going on
this might be okay because it sounds hyperactive behavior you have some specific problems that you need to talk aboutsome people looks at self have no idea what the fuck the problem isso if you have some shit that you need to get off your chest this is a good place to get some perspective
that sounds like a really really shitty place to be in right now
they did ill respond to them with my concerns and such thanks for checking in i was feeling a bit alone today
i do very much so shes the only reason ive made it this far however its unfair for her to constantly live with her condition as well as anxiety for me whereas if i were gone at least she would have something to mourn and then eventually accept im a living corpse and i hate that she has to see me this way
god this seems pathetic im pathetic
hey there i have a similar story to yours i posted it here last week you can read it if you like im not going to pretend to understand exactly what your life is like but i identify with a lot of what youre going through especially the social awkwardness and the academic issuesyou might not believe this because im just a random person on the internet but i do really care about you i dont know if that means anything to you but i hope it does i know how much it can pain to want to connect with people but not to be able to do you want to talk youre welcome to send me a private message if you dont feel like posting publicly
despite the horrible circumstances its nice to know im not alone im sorry about the breakup
your father is fully capable of taking care of himself what you need to anxiety about is your mental health and wellbeing dont let your father scare you into not getting the help that you need
you know that feeling of being really scared if you can overcome it and tell your parents anyway then you you will have made a huge step forwards brave people arent fearless they have the fear but do it anyway you could try showing them this post initially once you get it off your chest that alone should make you feel a whole lot better they love you right so theyll want to help you
i dont know what youre going through but i live my life number hours at a time some days those number hours feel like number youre going to pain people in your life its how it goes ive put a lot of people through a lot of grief in my life
my family has done their time so im no longer their problem
well i can tell you man that since i started my medication which treats both my depression and anxiety with just one pill my mood has improved some people do need both have you talked to your dr about this before
please dont kill yourself im here i will listen
the good point is youre still here and made it this far i dont want this to be a feel good post since im not good at those and this is my first time trying to give advice in the end its your choice if you want to live or not and given that youve tried in the past and havent succeeded means that there is still some part of you that wants to pull through you mentioned that you have best friends thats great better than myself im also depression and sometimes think life is some hellish thing to just get by with personally ive found the book feeling good the new mood therapy to be the best thing ive found with helping me deal with pessimistic thoughts and feelings of feeling hopeless it really made a positive impact on my life so far and i try and read it even when im apathetic and unmotivated some people are just lucky while we have to struggle such is life hope to hear from you soon
you should form a straight edge hardcore band and beat up the audience members when they come on stage like a straight edge gg allin self harmer nutcase crossed with henry rollins
dear angusyou sound like a wonderful person i read your replies to the other comments that were made on this page and from what i can tell you seem to be a good person genuinely good people are hard to find these days you know people who try their best to make others happy without asking for anything in return so i have a reason to stay alive for you stay alive because you are one of the few good things left in this world you know that word hope yeah people like you are the reason why we have it the world would be a lot dimmer without you it can be tough at times whenever you feel tired or upset think about the impact you have on other people the stranger on the street that you smiled at the woman whom you held the door for etc im sure you make a lot of people happy one upset person doesnt mean everyone is upsetgood lucktater
you mention legacy what is its use the way you touch and help people is timeless it is what people will remember you for you literally must not kill yourself life is not about destiny your destiny has not been written any impediments that you currently face can be washed away with ease every wasted dollar broken relationship and wasted time can be easily redeemed enjoy your new life
suicide in the family is something that never goes away every holiday birthday family gathering is taintedi dont know man the only thing that keeps me going is not wanting to pain my mom
yeah it really pain me dreams were where i went to enjoy freedom and happiness guess its just another contributing factor to my depression
i hope too thank you so much
more or less to put it precisely in order to have any kind of social interaction i have to be someone other than me another persona that appears more charming and interesting than i actually am the moment i start dropping the act the moment people start being less interested in talking to meit eventually gets to the point where i just dont know how to respond and end up either not responding at all or reaching for some prethought canned response that best fitsof course i could just never drop the act and have plenty of friends but theyd be fairweather friends at best and living that kind of lie seems worse than death
ok so we have some data on the experiment moving away doesnt help that hypothesis is disproved thats progress i wonder if there is anything else you can think of to try see if it will make a difference i can see in the way that you write and that youve written so much that you dont really want to have to go through with this but there seems like no other option its also worth keeping in mind that being depression you probably arent really seeing things tired clearly right now i say also this because ive struggled with depression for quite some time and know how different the same situations can seem when im depression vs when im not depression so i guess the second part of my question is can you maybe think of a way that a nondepression version of yourself might look at this situation from a problemsolving point of view
i imagine you hyperactive behavior writing keep doing it get someone to read it write some more put it out there there is meaning and purpose in all that we do sometimes we just need to look hard to find it i can see that it hurts im sorry that it does people are reading and listening to you
i know exactly what you irritable mood man i never want to tell anyone but i always want someone to ask just so i can some of it out but the problem is that no one ever asks and youre just ventricular dysfunction left alone with yourself and your sadnessmaybe hell pry a bit more i know ive said this before but dont you think hed prefer you opening up to him as opposed to you killing yourself and him knowing that he could have talked to you about it plus it goes without saying that you killing yourself would most definitely exacerbate his depression im sorry if im kind of guilting you out of this but im sure youre doing it already keep being a good friend though im sure he needs you just as much as you need him even though youre both unwilling to open up to the other howd today go when is your prom anyway or is that no longer an issue
they will they will look down on you because they dont understand you just keep being positive i dont know your living situation so changing your environment could be difficult sometimes you have to push through your current situation until a better one arises
several things that happened in my childhood that id rather not discuss and the death of my grandma she was basically my mum for the first number years of my life i dont see myself getting out of this depression any time soon its been the only constant in my life for this long it is me
i dont mind im number but that was my life for over number years
yeah i try to think of myself as independent but at a certain point i give in to my asthenia and realize i just need someone to talk to really talk to
oh geez old love long lost its the absolute fucking worst two years ago i woke up from a dream about a girl i was abnormal behavior for stupidly i got it in my head to see if i could find her to see how she was doing ive never been in a darker place in my life part of me is perfectly content and even happy that shes doing flippin fantastic the rest of me wishes i was the guy that made it fantastic its something ill always stupidly wish even though its impossible and has been impossible for over a decade im not even a person that dreams i felt hyperactive behavior fate was fucking with me for laughs vulcans had the right idea with suppressing their emotions they make you do stupid stupid thingsyour situation is definitely worse id say thats some unhealthy self torture however a woman can stop having romantic feeling for you but still be a genuine and true friend if your not just some chump to her that shes using to get out of her dads house and she really and truly cares for you try to think of it as breaking even thats really what life is all about isnt it how you think of something you lost a girlfriend and gained a female friend ive been told theyre worth moreplease dont confuse me as some sort of love guru or all knowing wise guy that strokes his fu manchu in some temple in the mountains spouting off nuggets of wisdom i cant tell you what to do or how to do it only what i think i would do in your position talk to her about this keeping your thoughts to yourself accomplishes nothing outside of making you more and more depressed mood if she was your girlfriend once and your friend now you should be able to talk to her tell her these things set some roommate rules hyperactive behavior no bringing boyfriends back to our place tell her why tell her you need time to move on theres no telling how it could go could go badly could go okay might even go well you wont know till you try communicating with her if she has to move back in with her folks for you to heal then she should understand right a true friend would do what needs to be done to help their friend at least thats how it should work those are the friends worth havingyou sound hyperactive behavior you have a couple of people that care about you that actually put up with you and your problems i wish i had more people hyperactive behavior that forgive me for being slightly envious im sorry maybe someday ill share my story and that statement would make worlds more sense anywayim afraid i dont know how to make things get better its hyperactive behavior the gijoes said knowing is half the battle no truer words have ever been spoken what i can say is that youre not in a terrible position for number okay the ex gf roommate thing isnt so great but you have your own place i assume you have a job to pay for it car youve had a relationship and arent a virgin friends that care enough about you to not stop being your friend when you crying reflex abnormal in their presence so your problem seems to be your roommate if knowing really is half the battle now you just have to actually do battle with the knowing you know now so talk to her tell her it tortures you to no end when she goes out with guys that arent you tell her you havent gotten over her but please dont do something youll regret i also think that if its possible you should try to apologize to the number year old lady that took time out of her life to spend with you think about it she is number years older than you and also on plenty of fish chances are things havent gone according to plan for her anymore than they have for you otherwise she wouldnt have been on a dating site her sad mood is something you should be able to sympathize with right then again im assuming a lot here she could just be a real cold bitch i honestly dont know even so shes probably quite lonely im being overly optimistic here but im sure she would understand why you walked out on her right now she is probably blaming herself which at number would be pretty hard for anyone genital diseases male or femalewell anyway im done happy birthday lol sorry couldnt resist youll be number soon youre obviously not social fear of females communicate it cant get better until you do
been there done that man im going to tell you what nobody told meteenagers arent in their right mindserious it isnt a psychological thing or anything its pure anatomy your brain is rewiring a crapload of neurons in your teens and that process makes you think truly stupid things are good ideas youre drowning in an overdose of hormones that your body needs but your mind really doesnt youre being overwhelmed from a biochemical standpoint and a neurological standpoint as well as having to spend multiple hours a day with beknighted idiots suffering through the exact same bullshit as yourselfi wont even get into whatevers going on in your life because its inconsequential to the problem youre in a shortterm medical crisis that is entirely chemical itll get better just like zits just like excessive sweating just like errant boners in math classtrust me youll have a much better handle on this stuff when you can think straight bookmark this link set a date on your calendar come back in a year and tell me whats changed and whats stayed the same suicide is forever number is just a year you might not be unfucked in the head by number but ill wager youll be on your way
do they hate you for knowing or tellinghow long have you felt this way did it start today how far have you considered your suicide for example do you have a method or a time in mind

i can kind of relate to the school thing i switched schools as a form of suiciderebirth i wanted to start a new life as a new me but now im stuck in an even worse spot than i was in before
im self taught though with a fair bit of experience and skillseven better all hail the autodidact for he is best at bootstrappingi dont have a daughter in anything but a financial sense i have no involvement in her life nor do i expect to ever have a good relationship with her what with the whole hermotherbeingthesymbolofallthatisevil bitsounds like youre letting the bitch win why would you want to do that did you ever think that maybe your daughter wants to know her father and that by taking your standpoint youre actively abetting her mothers schemeshowever for me even in a good job market i have no real financial independence and cant even afford a small apartment thats still a long goddamn way from i should off myself hell dude buy a surplus school bus put a franklin stove in it and live in it plenty of my friends set up numbersqft domiciles for less than numberevery time i get a raise or a better paying job she somehow learns of it immediately and my support payments go up a couple of weeks lateritty boo start doing handicrafts on the side wash dishes under the table not all income is declared income and when youre talking about killing yourself or bouncing a few nights a asthenia under the table there really isnt any parity of thoughti dont actually have much of anything to live for my life for over six years now has been one endless day of hell ive had it up to here with hearing about my obligations to other people who all so casually dismiss any towards me slaves have a duty to escaperun to fuckin mexico then no trust me go back and read it thats not what you saidi know what i wrote and i know who i wrote it to it wasnt to youheres a suggestion relating to people as fellow human beings rather than objects to be manipulated might be a better approachselfinvolved much ive spent the afternoon swapping tales with you specifically despite the fact that you were completely unknown to me before getting insulting and condescending to a total stranger objects to be manipulated youre the one who keeps asking for peoples help just so he can shut down any idea they come up with to continue to stew in your own juices heres my suggestion if you want help ask for it and listen to peoples responses imagine what sort of life youd have if you followed through with all of them to their completion rather than just shutting things down so you dont have to venture out of your comfortable cage slaves have a duty to escape youre so adamantly opposed to change it astounds me yet when you crank about people who casually dismiss obligations towards me you ignore the fact that youve got a living breathing daughter that youre paying for that you arent even bothering to consider
no ones depression should be discounted you could make the argument that a rich person shouldnt be depression because they should be able to buy simple comforts there are a lot of reasons for being depression but it will always be subjective and it shouldnt have to be validated it may be true that women with low selfesteem can find relationships more easily but that would probably be because some men like damaged women and feel more comfortable being in a relationship with a less confident partner possibly because they would be intimidated by a confident woman are these women really better off though sure they attracted a man but that man probably will not be able to instill selfesteem in the woman unless a person is able to create confidence for themself they will probably find it difficult to have a functional relationshipnot all women are attractive and not all women make friends easily there are certainly gender dynamics at work in all social contexts but anyone can struggle to find support if you want to find support your gender identity isnt as important as building effortful relationships and actively communicating with others that you care about them basically youll get what you give and if you expect people to be there for you you might need to be there for them first anyone can feel vulnerable and no one wants a relationship where the other person only ever talks about being depression and needing someone
im number wanna talk pm me ur number or skype or something i cut and have attempted suicide
ive been working my mind thinking of something to say and i keep drawing a blank and its because i dont know anything about youso i want to know more about you so before you do what you think is right and i aint going to give you advice or shit like that and try and dissuade you you got to let me learn a bit about i wanna know a guy before hes gone
what would your friends say if you told them about the numbermmtry it see what happens
i figured that from your post here but just know that od from tylenol will be an incredible uncomfortable and pain way to go how old are you bud and are you from the phils
woahhhhhhhh hold up yeswhat is the disability if you dont mind me askingthere are jobs that you can do from your computer you knowim not criticising you
the hotlines are there to get you the help that you need they can help you get counseling or connect you to other resources to get you back on track and find that next step
though it may be tough if you breakup focus on school relationships can be fixed as i have experienced this with my boyfriend well now ex is the relationship on the rocks because youre busy with school
oh wow this sounds so painfully like me some of the specific situations are different but the emotions are almost the same im going to reach out in a way i never do in real life and rarely online wanna be friends people like us need to support each other and help each other to be less lonely
starting is the worst its not just school for me its work life im glad youll get help hang in therei am at work so im ok if you need anything please keep talking ill be checking my phone
tried the therapy thing didnt help i have an appointment with the dr mid month this month ill see right now i am fighting the urge more than anything to cut
im speechless i really am i always see at least number negative thing in everything except you its strange im really speechlessim gonna stick around for a bit longer
exact same position as you gf cheated when she moved to england im number got skype pm me also attempt suicide last thursday
suspended doesnt irritable mood kicked out if youre feeling hyperactive behavior you cant handle school in general how about taking some voluntary time off work save up some money
we shall see what it does ive been on the current med for number year
yes whenever im walking around alone at night i wish some murderer would just jump out and kill me or i could save someone else me dying in the process i wish someone would just kill me because i cant get around doing it myself yet i wish something bad would happen to push me over the edge so i can just will myself to kill myself
thanks im really lonely right now
if you want to talk message me seriously dont hesitate
for your sake i hope they are sleeping you need not end what hasnt begun
actually it does make sense think youll find a lot of ppl in history have felt similarly the old ennui weltschmerz etceven your random what if thoughts about suicide you are not alone in
actually i get my therapy for free and my therapist has been wonderful there are plenty of places clinics and the hyperactive behavior what will be happy to help you even if you cant pay
id say you give her the chance to tell you how she feels then again for what ive read your relationship may not be at its best right now just see what she has to say im sure youll be able to figure out what to do after that if you dont think shell be part of the solution she is probably part of the problem and i know its hard to hear but if shes not gonna help you out you need to move on and focus on yourself
thanks i appreciate it
its okay i didnt mean to worry you i can tell that you are scared it sounds like some of the symptoms that you are going through arent good im not a paramedic or anything so dont take my word on it would you say that dbt works for you you said that one of them was mean to you so are there other counselorstherapists available someone in that position who is supposed to help being mean is pretty disgusting imo you dont deserve someone being mean to you when you are vulnerable
hey im sorry youre sad i know its easy to get focused on the moment but we all do terrible things its okay to feel terrible but i hope so much that youre still here and im glad you reached out can he still be your friend do you think you may be able to forgive yourself for depressed mood him
from the guardian article commentswouldnt attempt rates be less accurately reported than succes rates for actual suicides there is a body in most cases and a coroners report but how many attempts go unrecorded and what defines an attempt anywaysome suicide methods are easily identified even if they only result in a failed bid whereas others remain hidden to all but the attempter this is imoortant if as you say there is a difference in male methods and female methods these figures may not bear scrutiny
i sat here for a few hours staring at the pills i was gonna take but for now im gonna just go to sleep and talk to a doc tomorrow for the past number hours ive been just reading everyones stories and struggles with depression and suicide attempts cant tell anyone what im going to do for sure but if it comes to me attempting again then so be it but for now im gonna try something different and see how it turns out as of numbernumber im no longer smoking weed so idk how this is gonna turn out i read each and every comment throughout the day thanks for everything
silence go into the most sedated state place you can think about yourself not your problems not your past but your future think of something youve always wanted to do and go do it
ive just arrived at the place im going to spend my last day its peaceful and isolated just like my life has always been i understand what it is like to be autistic i hope you have found out a way to help yourself even though im socially awkward having friends wouldnt change a thing to my life
thank you tired much i hope four years from now it will be a distant and irrelevant memory
thats beautiful you ever think about pursuing a career as an artist i think youd make it with that type of talent keep the pen and pad close to you because you really have something amazing there
i admit this is such an attentionwhore thing for me to do its true its hard to say but its true its just that lately ive been feeling so unloved i just needed to hear it from someone even from a stranger even if they dont mean it i needed to hear it
it is maybeit can be the the biggest draw back in life that when the person you basically shared your whole life with and you think you irritable mood the world to the other person too that some time there comes the time where is it crutial and you say hey here i am i dont feel good here i am and then she is just gone and you thought you are something special to her and you realise okay maybe this was just the hope and maybe it was just the wish that you are so special to the other and you realise that it isnt hyperactive behavior that and it just chest pain so much how can a human cope with that
why are you disgusting
are you hoping that youll die or do you do it for the thrill and the adrenalin rush
number safe than sorry and it will put your friend on the radar to get the help he needs so he doesnt do it again
goodnight my friends iv always loved reddit bless all of you for listening to me ramble goodnight
i dont agree with live for others kind of advice i think you should live for yourself and your friends and family the world isnt going to be fixed any time soon so stop thinking its all on your shoulders
hey im in a similar situation none of my friends really understand why i want to die and whenever i go to them for help they get anger at me for making them feel guilty i think what people need to understand is that mental depression and suicidal tendencies dont have any rhyme or reason there can be triggers such as the ones youve listed but sometimes there really is no reason for it its just there this constant feeling of pain or regret or hopelessness or what have you so i guess what im trying to say is dont feel guilty or embarrassed by it and dont let others make you feel that way my experiences have taught me that as depressed mood as it is friends really arent the people to turn to most of the time they just have no idea what to do and react in completely detrimental ways coming here was actually the best thing ive done to help in a long time im here if you want to talk things over
no i never said leave her for someone new i said leave her shes bad for you and going to make you feel worse
youre right to question this stuff for now do your homework so you can pass school and learn stuff then go out into the respiratory distress syndrome adult world where you have more control over your decisions
to answer your question i have had positive experiences with club drugs when they work they completely eradicate my social anxiety i sometimes have a lot of trouble with coming down though sometimes no matter what i take i feel stuck in a state of avolition or anhedonia my tips for avoiding coming down too hard are to taper off substance use incrementally smoke cigarettes remain active and try to continue social contact for as long as possible
listen to the arrogant worms happy happy birthday song i sing this to my friends on their birthdays it is a little morbid so if you arent a fan of gallows humor give it a passor if you like i could sing it to you personally
basically my reply to harvnumber its a really petty reason to be sad but for some reason its killing me
i know how hard it can feel ive just come out of a suicidal spell myself maybe a asthenia agothere is no sharp pain fix but to force yourself to see the good in the worldnoone can help you if you wont help yourself and i know that you didnt get a fair deal to start and certainly noone will blame you for wanting to end it but we cant change the pastthe world is full of love i promise i was lucky i had a network of people to support me friends and family i kicked the weed and drink and im well on the road to recoveryyou need a big change and i swear on everything if you let it in and take steps to change your world you will see that life is pointless in the end but the ride can be fucking wonderfuli wanted to end the suffering myself but now im out i just want to take everyones hand who are there and drag them outi dont know you but i love you the pain has made me so much fucking stronger and if you get through this find love make a family of your own i know youll be invincible and getting through this and being a success despite the ashes you came from will make you proudyou have every reason to and i cant blame you but i want you to know you cant see it yet but its worth it i swear i really really do
if you want to please pm me
dont kill yourself its not worth it your taking the easy way out whatever is bothering you fix it get someone to talk to when i was going through hell years ago i wanted to go commit suicide i called a suicide hotline that day and the lady in the hotline told me that this will not only chest pain me but those around me the thought of my sickdisabled mother hit my head and i decided not to continue my planthat call saved my life i met the love of my life i have a great career and my mother is very proud of me graduating from college it was a dream of her since i was a child and i am her only child everyone is not perfect we all have problems here cheer up xoxo url
you need motivationbe your own you are here for the physical world materialistic stuffbut the intellectual world is here for you take time to be a part of ithumans are the only things on earth that can share life experiences travel what everyou may not feel important where you are because it does not need you but somewhere on earth people could use yousomewhere on earth you can take part in an experience that number of people wontyou need to find yourself save up and just goif you have a special someone take them with you if not go find themif you dont want that then let the world be your companionlife is too short to live it being in a place you have no motivationif you cant enjoy your life here and go enjoy it somewhere elseyou might just find a special place on the world that does motivate youlive a little and learn to love your lifego discover the world secret keeping to yourself for the next guy can find themyou will never find motivation if your situation doesnt excite you so my advice to yougo get enlightened about the world you live in
when you want to kill yourself but its too much effort to think about methods
wow thats quite a story i imagine it sucks losing all your friends i cant imagine how scary the prospect of that happening again would beif i read this correctly you accidentally passed on a secret to someone who shouldnt know the secret and people found out am i rightyou also say youve never considered it until today did you never consider it at all or never this seriouslyi really hope youll help me understand and perhaps help
okay haha it takes your eyes a bit of time to adjust to the dark and see the stars clearly but doing that made me feel at ease with the problems in my life kinda like how someone needs to be in a dark for a while before their eyes adjust to see the brighter things
you shouldnt do it because youre looking for a life in the wrong place this may sound odd but its true not everyone is made out for university despite what society leads you to believe find something you love doing and utilize that to make your living what do you like doing i may be able to help you out feel free to shoot me a pm if you want someone to rant to
that drives me crazy the text goodbye was clearly a call for help if he actually wanted to kill himself he would just do it without trying to reach out i would never do something hyperactive behavior that im either going to live or get this over with and die im sorry this may have been inconsiderate i hope the both of you improve and i dont care for anyone i just feel completely dead i dont look forward to seeing my friends at school its all shallow i hate trying to act happy all the time but whenever i begin to explain my mental depression it becomes far worse with the added anxiety they could tell anyone im just done
tired of being alone
im actually worried that i could be forced into treatment i cant risk that any idea what the deal is there presumably if he thinks i could be a danger to myself hed be obligated to report it that post of mine was a bit naff im not just a guy having an existential crisis this plan of mine has been gathering momentum for a while and is starting to feel inevitable im seeing the shrink on thursday ill test the waters
believe me no one wants to die and if she was the type of girl you explained she was a lot tougher than most as strong a girl as she was she wouldve have never chosen suicide if it were not serious girls never let out their real feelings specially if theyre mental depression related i dont know myself but thats just how girls are theyll smile the brightest when depressed mood it must have been a big deal to her that she took this step i understand her
have you tried taking the passive approach like just sitting there and not moving or thinking and letting the desire run through but not acting on itkind of hyperactive behavior meditating just clear your mind and sit perfectly still
whats your dream forget realistic
i wish i could have done the things you have done man all my life i have wanted to join the army because i too have a death wish you arent alone man the feeling of whats the point runs through my mind daily as i sink deeper into a pit of despair so maybe i am not the one to offer advice but maybe just maybe you gotta find something you believe in ask yourself the question of what you really want in life is it a nice job a family a nice house whatever it may be you gotta get yourself a goal to achieve dont be hyperactive behavior me and just live day to day because then you have nothing to look forward to find something and go and get it
my little brother possibly killed himself and let me tell you its been months and i havent gone a day without sobbing and considering suicide and feeling like my ribs were splitting apart please uholy_panda dont end your life or your brother may tired well end his he will never ever get over it grief will color his world grey for the rest of his life
i dont know i feel like im doing everything right and then the world punishes me for trying
honestly were it not for my children i certainly would have committed suicide by now
for me it took number years of help to get to point where i dont feel so bad so sometimes there is hope below you say that you love cats its good you can find things you enjoy also musical theatre sounds like good way to get your feelings out when things get too much just concentrate on them
only reason im still here is because i dont have access to a gun if i did or could get one easily i would be gone so i suppose im just waiting until i can
the apathy too only reason i didnt kill myself tonight is because i procrastinated until i thought i might be discovered
im actually decentish at drawing considering that in total ive been doing it for a few months but im getting zero fulfillment out of it the same counts with archery and juggling but also more passive things hyperactive behavior movies and videogames nothing i do is good enough i cannot live up to other people and i shouldnt want to live up to other people but i cant shake that feeling i should want to do things for myself live for myself but everything i do is to fish for recognition achievements and admirationand indeed ive talked about this with my partner but i dont want her to see me as a student nor do i want to see her as a teacher im so vain i want to be at least her equal but ill never be i hate feeling this way hate comparing us hyperactive behavior this i chest pain myself so much constantly and i cant stop itas for throwing my potential away if i kill myself i wont exactly notice the struggle will be over and ill be gone
fair enough just wanted to suggest it and if its helping you and serving a purpose in your life more power to you
absolutely this is unusual behavior for her the questioning and sentence structure and it would probably be in her best interest to seek some help you could address it casually by bringing up that it concerns you how it makes you feel to hear her talk like that ask her how she is really truly feeling let her know that you love her and loved by others remind her of things she might not have thought of lately such as how beautiful hardworking and how you admire her for all that she does mothers day is coming up great opportunity to let her know that you appreciate all that she does
come on man it cant be that bad how awkward could you possibly be and unless youre verbally abusing your friends i doubt youre fucking up your phobia social relationships no one gets into their reach school thats why theyre called reach schools college is college is college is college youll get the same experience everywhere why was yesterday so great and what made this fit so terrible
maybe considering dedicating your life to the betterment of people in need so many people wish to be in a better position and so few people actually help maybe you can use your life to help other people doing that brought a lot of joy to my life having someone who is genuinely thankful for the help you can provide for them is when the happiest things anybody can do and it is not that hard to be good at
you know there are perfectly happy adults who have thought of suicide at least once most people do you arent alone in that vein
hey i know its easy to feel hopeless when things are looking down have been looking down it probably seems hyperactive behavior a lot of things are pushing down on you right now but may i ask whats bugging you the most the job search your old job that you dont want to talk to your girlfriend
yeah happened to me too you cant change who you are at least its damn exhaustion to i moved around a lot as a kid and every time id end up as the lister and then the loner once the friendmaking period is over and everything sets in to equilibrium its really hard especially when everyone else around you is chatting away with their new friends looking happy but i dont think theres anything wrong with being who you are in the first place youre justrare there arent as many people with this kind of personality youll find a match facebook helped me a lot because im kind of inhibited in real life like i cant think of things to say in time if youve talked to a classmate for a bit they wouldnt find it odd at all if you asked for their facebook then you can chat away and eventually you could tell them what youve told us you can do that online too its fine this is all from my own experience and i admit im making a lot of assumptions that my problems are the same as yours i mean it sounds like youve got some social life but whatever may help
ive never done this before is it weird of me to ever ask you for a phone conversation i know its some creepy and probably an onerous request but this is the first time in my life i ever felt the need to just reach out to a complete stranger and crying reflex abnormal
depression doesnt distinguish by tax bracket have you sought help in the form of counseling
i used to game a lot but here lately i just sit at home in my room and either drink or crying reflex abnormal myself to sleep i dont really have any interest in anything right now my hobbies are work i do that so i can continue to have a place where i can sleep i had a gun for a long time but in a moment of clarity i sold it i have had so many people tell me that i have so many issues i just need some positive influences in my life but can never find any i am so exhaustion of it always being the same
i think just being there for him will help and so will reminding him that you do love him and that youre here for him if he ever wants to talk
what used to make me happy its been years since i was happy for more than a few minutes i guess i like making things programming art stuff like that but i havent been able to concentrate much on anything or i will plan something out then just lose all drive and dont follow though on building it
that helped a lot and im on amazon now buying hitchhikers i think that will help because moments when im not doing anything i tend to dwell a book in general should helpim tired open with my girlfriend she knows what ive been going through and ive been pushing myself to go out i think im scared of being stuck like this forever being disconnected i want to get betteri kinda know that the way to overcome this is to not think about it not to dwell and sometimes i feel alright and then i start thinking hey im alright and then i ask myself what im doing to make myself better and then tits im dwelling againits a bit bollocks to be honesthowever people have pointed out that i have complained about the spaced feeling whenever im in a tired stressful situation like when i had a job interview at time out and actually when i was in therapy come to think of itbut thankyou this did really help and ill take your advice i want to get better and im going to really fight to do it i break down into tears sometimes and often i think its all pointless but you know im going to keep going
its good to laugh despite it being a very sad laugh the point of life to some is amassing fortunes to others its dedicating their life to help others for little to no pay at all im not telling you to pack your bags and to move to africa but there must be something you enjoy doing you say you enjoy weed wow and parties thats not uncommon for a number year old its a lot more common than you may think so dont take it as a negative in any sense of the word do whatever makes you happy and disregard what others say
they use it as a threat to keep you alive im im the same boat as you with my girlfriend i tell her and they threaten to call the police it keeps you alive thats all i can say
i know how that is my dad cheated on my mom when i was number and then they separated the thing is what i failed to grasp for the longest time is that their problems are their problems they may be having a very difficult time right now but youre not involved and its not your fault things will look up eventually for them and for you i promise they may not be together but sometimes breakups are for the best all three of you can still be happyalso have you considered counseling if you dont want to tell your parents that you want to talk to a therapist you can always go to your guidance counselor assuming youre in public school it really helps to have someone to talk to
you need a sponsor like recovering drug addicts but someone who is also struggling with mental illness being alone is the difference between life and death no one should have to be alone maybe find another person on suicidewatchand obviously dont do it i dont know you so i cant tell you how awesome you are all i know is that you have kids if you cant live for you live for them if you kill yourself those screams theyve heard will haunt them forever they need you and care about you if you have no other reason to live let it be them
hey buddy i cant im in the same situation but there are a few similarities i too have got thousands of pounds of debt from uni live in uk after not even completing four years in my overdraft credit card debt and unemployed right nowwas at a job as well where i wasnt terribly good and fairly depressed mood during that time not really knowing where the hell i was going is there anyway to extend the debt repayments so that you could save some money to go for some night classes that are it related
okay thank you for being honest with me
if you get more info possible location call the police in the country and try to get him some help perhaps his name on reddit will help
ive been clean and doing well since spending three months in inpatient two years ago
i was married to an abusive manfelt asthenia and suicidal because i thought there was no way out my children were separated and i just couldnt handle it all i lived alone with nothing nearest friends and family are about number miles away the original post came two days before my water broke at number weeks
glad to hear that youre looking for a solution thats a first stepas for involvement with the law i cant help much all i can say is that using your time incarcerated as productively as possible is all you can do also listen to your lawyer and dont talkafter that packing up and moving somewhere can be great for the troubled mind just make sure you have a plan when you get there often you can crash on couches found on craigslist for a few days while you figure out a job after that its up to you
hey just got back home went and visited my grandmother for the weekend was planning on messaging you its been kind of a depressed mood week ive lost most of my friends because of this stupid bullshit that im going through and im just frustrated i dunno if or when things are going to blow over i messed around in my closet again seeing if i had the courage to actually go through with it but i didnt it would absolutely kill my parents i think so ive just been keeping on riding it out what about you i hope youve been doing better
im part of a community where most people have dealt with or are dealing with mental health issues honestly you may just have shitty unsupportive friends the most trying times of your life is when you find out who your real friends are
he doesnt want help i dont know hes being weird dont know where he is at the moment gonna link him
i know its easy to believe that people as a whole are awful and hell you might be right but its easier to destroy than create and yet somehow after all these years we as a human race have managed to build something a global society thats well thats just a little bit better than what came before doesnt that speak to something man i see why you wouldnt want to be part of the equation anymore what with all the shit that is going around right now not arguing that it isnt but have you thought about how big this equation is its massive number billion strong and thats just us humans have you thought that you could surround yourself with the better elements of that equation be one of them
thing will get better college can happen at any age it doesnt have to happen now you got lots of time my suggestion is give it some more time check out some more resources sometimes when things are done in a pinch they dont work as well can you go to a college that is local so you can live at home work get financial aid and go to schoolmy other advice to you is if these people were truly your friends they wouldnt just not communicate with you in truth most people dont keep their high school friends through out life
im here for you i can text call skype whatever no judgements please pm me if youre interested hang in there
i dontt know why this song always cheers me up alittle bit url
youre not alone were with you
i have i just get lethargicsleepy unfortunately mixed with alcohol i get tired tired sick
hey i think you misunderstood i cant commit suicide because it would crush my parents im not thinking about depressed mood anyone besides myself
she listened to what i said told me that i should stay strong itll get better
what was the best part of number for me the best part was reading about people that got out of mental depression in number how willing most of them were to try and aid others with mental depression it gives me hopewhat are my new years resolutions look at what i have not what i couldve had or can have in the future i will try very hard to keep up that thought ive been looking at the future and past for a long time missing the present achieving goals for no other reason than to look past them i hope for that to end in number what are you to say at the party tonight when it comes down to questions hyperactive behavior these if youre worried about peoples responses to your real answers to these questions you can say that you dont know if you arent worried about their responses and simply dont know well perhaps instead of thinking about whats the best about number just find something that was good during the year perhaps spending time with some specific people getting a nice gift from someone playing a fun videogame anything your new years resolution fulfil your desire to get out of where you are now sorting out your internal stuff or nothing at allhappy new year
nothing as in i have no other avenues of support you misread
well you know you can always come speak to us and we wont be pissed off at you for anything nor will you have to trust us i have been in a similar situation to yourself i lost my partner after being together for number years and even still after a year i think about them they will always be apart of your life and its completely human to feel the loss of that attachment as for your life do you have the option to go to a different school and try something completely new i know it seems hyperactive behavior a huge gamble and most people wouldnt understand however a fresh start might be something that you need to get away from the routine you have now never give up and feel free to talk anytime
i finally am too thank you
maybe it would help to start first with the symptoms and then move towards the root of the issue you and your therapist could be thorough that way in getting all the details so that you can be successful in dealing with the real cause whatever you decide to do i hope everything goes well for you keep your chin up
strange coincidence im just busy listening to it never ends by bring me the horizon im not sure whether it stops or goes away but i suspect it might change and that we might have an influence over how to change it but its so damned difficult right
i dont hyperactive behavior opiates they just help take away my mind for a little
just remember that no one is there to judge you or has a right to keep your head up
thats good to hear i know how hard it can get at times i hope that your therapist can offer some help as well its good to get all that you can
acetaminophen is severely liver toxic quite low doses will affect your liver i dont think with what you took you will have to be worried though also try getting help before you give up sometimes it helps and when it does its worth it also there might be some underlying issues under that depression but the most important thing is that you are entitled to feel any way you do but im sad that you feel like this no one should pain so badly that they want to give up
thats the other problem in order to be self employeed on probation i have to be incorporated and licensed i dont have the capital to do that
yeah that last paragraph had the spirit dont beat yourself up for other people leaving thats life people came into your life and people go out as for that one person you go to who you say you basically torture with your sadness just go to them to hang out and be with somebody im sure you arent torturing them but if you do feel that way just talk to them about other issues like how their day was just an example not implying that you never ask that but hopefully you get the jist of what i am saying
dont know theres a girl someone who has always been close to me even though we have never dated or anything she always told me i was good with words always doubted it never wrote in my free time or anything never pursued it since you enjoy i will copy and paste the other things ive written i reactivated my facebook after starting this just to talk to her and although i wont copy and paste all that i will say this i didnt hold back today with my words what is above this and will be below this is the outcome i feel like its just different chapters to my life cant explain this so i will just post and hopefully you can explain it to me
dont cut please someone close to me has cut himself all over his body chest arms legs stomach and he is now embarrassed of his deep deep scare tissue not that scar tissue is what you are thinking about right now but hopefully you see what i am getting at please it isnt worth it
hey therewhere do you live man id love to meet someone new relationships always evolve you meet new people you form bonds and connections sometimes they last a long time and others move on its a normal process that every relationship has and i am sure that many people have experienced this i know i have although your high school relationships may have ended this is a new start to meeting more people in your life whether it be through work school career volunteering going to clubs bars pursuing your favourite hobby there will be new connections with people
be her better half you have to put yourself in her situation to understand what you have to do i was once the depressedsuicidal friend and i had no one youll have to be there for her just about all the time so she doesnt feel alone even if you think the situation isnt that serious it is for her and it should be for you too youre being a great friend and an amazing human being for not just leaving her to deal with it on her own
no dont thank me the pleasure is mine knowing you care about your friends
what has lead to these feelings
i have stuff i like doing and its fun and all but underneath im dying inside so its not enjoyable and the meds arent working im hopeless
rightim actually a bit social fear these days i thought things were going to get better i live in a place where im surrounded by people my age just fucking tons of them and no one wants to do anything with me when my neighbors wont do more than talk to me in a patronizing tone then hook up with each other where associates and peers are constantly dating moving on with their lives and they just give me that look if i dont initiate contact contact is never made beyond pleasantries it never goes anywhere friendships ended when i stopped calling no one shows any romanticsexual interest unless theyre a good looking dude behind mei think im eventually just going to get fed up and buy a gun that seems way easier than jumping a bit more control over when and wherei was where you were at your age well mostly give or take my numbers were just shamefilled days smirks in my direction phobia social cuckolding and eventually getting to the point where all i can do is scream inside my head spend an hour here and there curled up wondering where it all went wrong why people wont even give me a chance the sexual frustration is mindboggling i dont really masturbate too shameful too aware of the fact that its not supposed to be done by self by handit seems to be some combination of looksattractivenessheightetc confidence at the right time in the right way happiness stoicism being in the right place at the right time projecting the right image not projecting an image at all and just being yourself navigating a phobia social minefield laid and fucking magic
i cried half way reading your post thank you just thank you
just explain to him frankly that his actions arent up to snuff dont feel hyperactive behavior you have to walk on eggshells or anything but do try not to put the blame on him but rather his actions
its good that you want to mend whatever issues you have with your brother you have hope for your situation now youre reaching out which is also goodwould you feel comfortable going into detail about your problems
there are always people that want to listen and help you just have to find them you found me a random stranger who happened to click on this subreddit and this post the night after he almost committed suicide in order to find help i realize that its difficult to change the mindset of how it all seems to be hopeless and bleak but theres one thing that i can ask and thats do you help yourself youre working for a fortune number company but was that what you wanted to do do you have hobbies to take your mind off things are you taking classes in things that interest you or spending time doing things you enjoy if not then please start maybe this is the time to start joining a gym playing a sport reconnecting with old acquantences if you still have any contact information of old friends just make sure to do something for yourself
ill miss you
thats why i have been alive this long there were times when i was just about to kill myself and stopped she will respect my decision once its made you know what my mom doesnt have anyone in this world who loves her not even me im incapable of showing my love to her im mentally that damaged i know for a fact that she is alive just to care for me she is suffering a tired pain life for me if im gone shell either leave all this and live life the way she initially wanted or shell also quit i would be happy if her beautiful soul is out of its misery
i have been in a similar situation in drug abuse school my best guy friend arguably my best friend period fought with me a lot or we fought with each other we spent almost every day together because it became hypothermia natural to do so and it wasnt that we didnt have other friends we were just so familiar it wasnt until our senior year after four years of being friends that i found out he had been in love with me his best friend told me he never would for that reason because he couldnt share his feelings with me we fought to the point of hating each other it drove me abnormal behavior knowing that my best friend could be hiding something of such stature from me and at the same time i didnt even know if it was true because i was too afraid to ask at risk of sounding pompous i went through some of the same emotional ups and downs as you i contemplated ending my own life more or less fantasized about it all the while knowing i never could or truly wanted to but the point is to this day three years later we still cant even be in the same room the you person who knows the most in the world about me cant even look at me you need to be able to talk to her lay everything absolutely everything out on the table this doesnt irritable mood you need to resolve your friendship it just means you clearly need closure there are obviously feelings being concealed on either end because if you knew exactly how she felt and vise versa you wouldnt feel so hopeless talk about it as awkard or difficult and heart wrenching it may be you have to get it all out before you can finally move on
thank you so much for the advice the only real problem i guess i have now is that i told my dad that my suicidal thoughts and tendencies had gone away and now i need to have my parents get me to a therapist dont want to seem like a liar again
well for one youve got a computer theres hundreds of thousands of articles to read free booksurl musicurl moviesurl thats all without illegal downloading youre also free to do that if you wish but i cant encourage iton top of that im assuming you have the freedom to leave your room if you wish in that case you can go for a walk watch people in a public area go to a library find a good place to watch the sunset from etci know its hard believe me you ask why any of that would be the least bit fulfilling i only ask that you try it
i can relate to a lot of what youve said and ive sort of self diagnosed myself with avoidant personality disorder maybe you have that too i guess my only suggestion is maybe try using the internet to make real life friends its a lot easier for me to talk to people in that environment and it makes it a lot easier talking irl if its with someone who is already your friend i dont know if you have the same problem people will want to be with you youve got this whole shyquiet thing going on people like that just remember that youre not alone and i really feel your pain wish i could do more to help but im looking for answers myself
url guy needs some help right now im going to have to go
if you dont mind elaborating what was the opportunity you had to kill yourself and how did you become a quadriplegiceither way that truly sucks man noone would judge you for committing suicideurl i dont know if im allowed to post links its not my channel or anything this guy makes some nausea number min vids about the incredibility of the human mind just watch one
i hope you both can read this reading both of these things and seeing you respond to each other is totally just crushed me it is so sad to see other people caught in between caring so deeply for others and caring so little for themselves that it actually becomes detrimental in itself clearly you both have huge hearts and you are full of emotion and it would really suck a lot if you guys werent able to share that with the world anymore and i know you both probably arent concerned about my opinion on the matter as you stated above but i think you want someone to share it with you anyway or else you would have posted in the first place you deserve everything all the greatness to be had in your life is for you and you deserve it
i came late to this but it looks hyperactive behavior youre already having somebody to correspond with and it seems to be somewhat effective in taking your mind off thingsyou say you read books dealing or talking about philosophy and about existentialism thats wonderful not everybody has that deep understanding of how life can be so meaningless and yet its meaningfulyoure in a great position to not only boost yourself but your entirely family up spend money on things thatll make everybody happy while it may seem insignificant to you the smallest gestures goes a long way in anothers mind i come from a similar background hyperactive behavior you while im still in school i always felt hyperactive behavior a major fuckup to my parents theyre asian and my brothers are only moderately successful im the odd one in the family and ive always had the reputation of being the one child that they relied on to be successful but was noti dont know what youre thinking your problem is youre selfemployed youve a beautiful character about you your deep understanding seems to be resounding your family members are still close to you albeit they may not be as responsive as youd hyperactive behavior and youve people counting on you to survive thrive and entirely fuck up the hypothermia natural world with your suicidal thoughts hey man if youre already contemplating suicide you might as well go out hyperactive behavior a badass youre already destined with death might as well go seek it yourself guns blazingit is selfish it is very selfish for drunk individuals but youre at an age where you can get away from thati suggest meetupcom and look for meetings within your areas dont shy away seriously just strap up and say fuck it ive nothing to lose so im going to just go out guns glazing and i dont give a fuck anymore and guess what this guys probably in a worse situation than you and look at this awesome levels of notgivingafuck url is selfish you and i are a bit selfish too but the difference is you can support yourself and you can make respiratory distress syndrome adult decisions without anybody slapping your ache wrists and nobody can judge youi seriously want you to go to a gym the first step is to sign up and go go every single day work on your chestback on mondays your legs on tuesday your armsshoulders on wednesday and try to run on thursdays on friday mornings go to hikes with people from meetupcom theyre more than willing to accept new members fuck they want new members where do you live ill make a fucking account for you and ill sign up and ill flirt with girls and get them all excited to see you mother fucker woooooodont take my advice passively ive been where youve been though im not your age and ive understood the idea of a meaningless life so damn intimately but some anonymous people reach out to me and i cant fucking be idle while there are others who may be in worse situations but without any appropriate outlet thats why im starting a club at my school to give a voice to those who dont have one im doing something with my mental depression what are you doing
thats a lot of medication and therapy it must be even more frustrating seeing as it doesnt seem to be working im curious seeing as youre number i had the impression that you were much older what specifically havent you succeeded at and more importantly what would you like to succeed at
saying someone cant be sad because someone may have it worse is hyperactive behavior saying that you cant be happy because someone has it bettersometimes you have to distance yourself from the people who only talk down on you
that sounds reasonable some things do indeed need taking care of
i think you are probably suffering from depression if your insurancemonetary state allows it try to go see a doctor to be tested if not just talk to people about your problems friends parents siblings etc or if not shoot me a pm i may not have the right answers but if you need to im right here
who are they your family
im sorry i thought id already responded ive been swamped with finals your second paragraph is funny actually because i was thinking that too except vise versa that you were a manifestation of my own internal conflicts but we both know thats highly unlikely i am sending my thoughts to your head and you me but despite the little weight that these words may carry i just want you to know how much i dont want you to commit suicidehow have the last few days been any good days
ive tried exercise i was running regularly and it wasnt really helping now i just feel like not leaving my room so thats sort of out of the question
where do you live im studying in an asian medical school though im just a beginner if possible i can help you out by introducing you to good psychologist here
okay thats fineits a lot of things i have bipolar and the past asthenia and a half i was manic now ive crashed and am depression just standing up takes so much out of me sometimes i dont even have a reason to be depression my bf is supportive and cares a lot but i feel like eventually its going to get to him and he will break or leave me i feel like he doesnt put me first aside from his son his son is first but i meant other than his son i am feeling so alone right now and i feel like the best option is suicide i realize its not the only option but its the one i see that will be best i will never get rid of my bipolar and ill always feel so damn awful inside and will be alone forever because of the way i am despite taking medication i hate myself and i have anxiety that prevents me from going in public a lot when im manic i see shit and and crazyi have panic attacks often and i feel discouraged i just want to feel respected and most of all happy i fantasize about putting a gun to my head and pulling the trigger a part of me feels like i wont even do it because im scared theres a hell and that ill burn forever especially because i just had an abortion im fucking damned im a pussy because i cant even gain the strength to kill myself but lately i feel like im caring less about the consequences and fears i just want to be gone forever
youre not going to hyperactive behavior this but you really need to leave her shes not good for you as for your own mental depression talk to your parents and or a doctor depression in teens is a common problem but it isnt necessarily a life sentence you can feel better if you get some help
you sound hyperactive behavior an incredibly strong person all i can do is listen but please know that im doing that its ok to feel weak youve been strong for so long through so much there is no shame or guilt in the way that youre feeling i know its hard to see but if anything you should be proud of the fact that youre here and youre still going please stay
it really depends on what sort of therapy youre doingsome will just sit and listen whilst they ask you questions about your life some will offer advice and try come up with solutions with you some a mixture of bothit really just comes down to the person whatever happens theyre not just going to brush you off s promisehope things get better feel free to replymessage if you want too hear more about what goes on had number sessions finished them a while back
you sound out of control or your life at least i think you have to love yourself more than anything before others can love you if weight is a problem you really have to ask yourself which do you love more food or not being over weight start by cutting out soda and fast food take some time to walk or bike or some activity you enjoy it will come eventual be patient you need to find something that makes you feel good about you and stop looking for it from other peopleedit found your pics and you are not what i would consider fat second part of my comment still applies and exercise might help you feel better emotionallyi had friends that were really good people in drug abuse school i never understood why people would hangout with other people that treat them hyperactive behavior shit its just the world because years later i really dont have close friends now you still might find one or two though
first its great that you are trying to understand her rather than judging her second dont feel guilty about not knowing when i started cutting i was an honor student at a good college had a lot of friends and was involved in school activities sometimes those are the ones the most vulnerable because they put too much pressure on themselves my parents felt awful that they didnt know what was going on but it wasnt their faultif you feel she is in immediate danger seek medical attention however most cutters have no intention of seriously harming themselves the best advice i can give is to not try and fix it for her talk to her spend time with her hug her and tell her youve got her back i know its hard to not be emotional but try to control your feelings when youre with her just do anything you can to let her know that youre by her side and youll help get her through it
please tell us youre still there talk with us please
oh okay the psychologist did they actually give you a new perspective on things you were anxiety about ie did they tell you anything you didnt already knowalso if you dont mind me asking whats your job im constantly astounded when i see so many employees in a supermarket or somesuch at an entrylevel job when theyre numbernumber not that i think anyones inferior for thatits mine and basically everyones biggest fear that ill end up with minimal prospects and a deadend boring jobit scares me to see if ill actually get to that point and i further wonder if id be able to accept my life at that pointis this something youve had help with adjusting to or we what do you thinkps interestingly ive always wanted to die most when im feeling truly exhilaratedcontent at my peak not in a druggie sense but out of fulfillment the further my prospects fall the less i want to die and the more anxiety i become but im not really sad cause it really doesnt irritable mood anything and i can just die whenever
does your school have mixers or reunions for alumniyou could join a toastmasters group and improve your public speaking and maybe networkthere must be some american association of financial analysts type professional organization with a chapter in chicago you could give them a ring and offer to help organize their next meeting or maybe they have a happy hour once a month

have you gone to a therapist i have a friend who has pretty bad mood swings but he has learned to control them by having people tell when hes approachable or not and through exercise and taking some care of himself i dont know if you get what i mean i admit hes a difficult person to work with but in no way deserves to have no one to care about him a couple of other workmates and i appreciate him quite a lot do you work or study

hes right part of depression is the overwhelming loneliness we think that no one could possibly have felt this bad that no one exists that is like us it is all a mental block you have to change your brain chemistry for me and my fear not going to specify i told myself some day ill be okay with it i knew it didnt have to be right away and it took some of the pressure away plus knowing that id feel better some day made the current day more bearable

thats bound to happen parents dont like letting go of their little kid who need a handle to hold walking across the street but im sure youll get through it just try to calm him down and if that doesn work give him some space and time to cool off
i disagree you are choosing to talk to me
then ask me dont say what youre telling that kid is wrong by the way you didnt say i feel like killing myself because my parents dont fully accept the fact that im gay and i feel trapped in eastern europe with no education you said conniving baby mamma who i begged not to have my child and ruin my relationship with the woman i loved did it then takes most of my income i have no money no realistic prospects for a family or good education no chance of ever pursuing my dreams fed up with unrewarding slavelike existence and need alternativesthose two experiences dont meet at any single point and having read your link it seems that you arent at all interested in getting advice youre interested in shutting down a whole bunch of reasonable advice so that you can continue to feel sorry for yourselfso are you feeling like killing yourself then we should talk about that you should make a post and we can talk this is a tired supportive forum for stuff like that but when im not talking to you im talking to a person threatening to kill themselves the arguments that are convincing to you two days later have little to do with whats convincing to themand hey i spent the weekend thinking the kid was dead turns out he isnt so maybe it workedi care a lot more about what he thinks than what you think
its so hard not to all of my college friends are married the friends ive made since then are also dropping like flies they for the most part have jobs that even if they arent happy with are at least paying the billsbut youre right i know this i know things will get better i just want the pain to subside and the images of me ending it to stop going through my head
actually you can learn confidence sure its harder for some pplespecially after a lifetime of no confidence or setbacks but its still sth you can learn intelligence on the other hand is not sth you can just learn you luckily have that with intelligence you can learn charisma google how to learn charisma etc youll find theres stuff out there remember no baby is born with many of these things they learn them if anything id say we are born naturally confident we simply unlearn it from bad life experiences which implies we can learn it again

definitely not easy i live in the southeast us as for unemployment support as odd as it may seem i really dont want that i want to earn my money i want to know that my money is given to me because i did something not simply because im down on my luck as i said ive been homeless and i cant tell you how much it breaks my heart to see someone thats obviously struggling give me money for a meal it just feels wrong not that i dont appreciate it but i feel that it isnt right taking money from another soul who needs it nowadays i spend my nights in drunken sadness as my friends seem to think booze solves all of lifes problems and honestly id rather die than fall back into that path its a dark and morbid reality to live in i guess what im trying to say is that i want to live life earning my living from those who can afford to pay someone to do honest work rather than taking it for no work from someone who needs it and seeing as that doesnt seem to be reality i dont see much reason left to live in such a world
ive had that parent figure that called me selfish to me i was personally pain by that comment id recommend that you just try not to dwell on those behaviors they do nothing to help you im not sure how to deal with that myself it still hurts years after the comments were made and still think that about myselfin any case it does help to talk to someone im currently trying to convince my apathetic and scared self that it will be beneficial if i just talk to someone even if i bawl my eyes out i hate when that happens but tears do have healing properties

so heres why i want to do itive been suicidal since i was in second grade because it being suicidal runs in my family i started really thinking deeply about it in fourth grade but nothing ever happened last year was easily my worst year and my best year all wrapped up in a big ball of deadly emotions it was my best year because i finally got the courage to tell my parents that i was suicidal it was my worst year because i tried to kill myself three times that same year after talking to my parents i felt this wave of happiness and clarity that made me feel like i really did belong here lately however the feeling are coming back and theyre stronger than theyve ever been before other than the times that i really tried to kill myself i try to make people laugh everyday because it makes me feel like even if im doomed to a life a despair and feeling unhappy if i could bring a smile to someone else face i could at least feel like im benefiting somehow recently i feel like an empty shell of my former self i feel like no matter how hard i try to stay happy the world keeps shooting me back down to reality but reality sucksjust recently i moved from a school where i knew almost everyone and could have easily made friends with anyone i wanted everyone in my grade respected me anybody else looking at my life from the outside would think that my life was great that i had no pain no suffering constantly going through my head but they were wrong i cried myself to sleep almost everyday last year and decided that i couldnt go on living this way anymore i wanted to move in with my dad and start school over there i felt like a fresh start was something that would clear up my entire life and allow me to live stress free i was wrong nobody knows me for who i really am im living a fake life in a fake shell of who i really am and it sucks i cant move back because then my grades would drop again but if i stay here any longer i feel like everyday im getting closer and closer to my fourth attempt at suicide i could go on for a while about the reasons i want to end my life because theyve been building up since i was in fourth grade however im number and have school tomorrow so i cant tell my full story just yet anyways theres an extremely rough outline of my story up until now thanks for caring

are you willing to wait until spring can you imagine the peace of your final sunset looking out across blossoms and warm winds im assuming youre not in the southern hemisphere of course beautiful sights the sounds of life returning to the world and the smells of spring those would be good sensations to take with youthe answer to your question is not just about height its about what you land on and which bit of you lands first land on stone or concrete and land with your head please dont yell at me for answering the question rather than saying dont do it better that he tries and succeeds in this case than tries and maims himself every yard taller the building is is about numbermph faster until you reach terminal velocity at about number yards or about number storeysthe problem is that the surer you try to be the higher you have to jump from and so the longer you have to change your mind on the way down thats not a hypothetical scenario either people do occasionally survive jumping and that midpoint regret is not uncommonmidwinter is in number weeks literally the darkest point of the year in every sense would you be willing to set a hypothermia natural date for the end something magical a date to rejoin the person youre missing spring solstice or the appearance of the first blossoms on the trees
by simple math youd be in numberth grade by now i assume i just finished grade number and i can tell you after drug abuse school it gets much better ive never been seriously suicidal but i still found it so much better people are people if youre introverted hyperactive behavior me then go at youre own pace you dont need number friends just maybe number or number good friends and avoid everyone else its worked for me through drug abuse school tldr go at your own pace school sucks sure but drug withdrawal syndrome through the last years and i promise you it gets better
that and analyze the way you think why do we all think we have to achieve something special its the same reason we want to have kids to live on forever or at least our genes or our name once you realize that your head is basically fucking with you its easier to just let these thoughts be and to not act upon them dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with trying to achieve something for yourself but if it doesnt work out you shouldnt worry about it we all suffered from conditioning throughout our lifes thats why we think we are not worth it or why we seek happiness in the wrong placestry to not look at what others have instead try to look inside yourself and see what little thing can make you happyi meditate and have to say that things are getting more and more clear for me we have a lot of baggage in our lifes meditation helps me to see this baggagehell it lets me laugh about it its like you see your mind telling yourself you are not worth it but you know its just conditioning of your mind it lets you see these things objectively helped and is helping me a lot pm me if you want to talk or if you want any more details about meditation
no matter whether you believe in fate or god or anything that misfiring gun was a sign and im really thankful for it i hope you can use this extreme experience to your advantage
i think one of the hardest things about this is feeling alone i just want to be able to hear that someone loves me not just family especially with my bipolar and schizoness i dwell on things hyperactive behavior that and get really really depressed i just hate the thought of being alone even though i have my son and family not having her to talk to at night kills me and having to forget all of those happy memories is something i dont want to do but ill end up having to if i want to move on right now is the hardest part of my lifeyet
like uregretnope said theres certainly no need to rush this why not wait and talk whats the worst part about your life
you also need to understand that you cant expect people to stop their lives because you dont trust the people around them its not your opinion you cant control people just yourself and if you feel she doesnt appreciate you then maybe its time for a change rather than death getting a new gf is rough but its better than biting the dust wouldnt you say
i had a dream about somebody else having an epsiode not me and i was trying to talk to that person and calm her down it was really freaky and i kind of was shocked that i dreamt this its like reality hit me in my dream i think you wereare focussed on it and thats why you dreamt it
try to not take what your sister said too seriously its easy to say something that you dont irritable mood when youre angry let her sedated state down and if you still feel sad about what she said talk to her
extreme depression and loneliness i do it to cope and to distract myself from this worthless excuse for a life
im afraid i have to respectfully disagree for a start if you had no value you wouldnt have the job secondly you absolutely do have valueskills are not things we are born with we learn them you can always learn skills
i also just wanted to say i think its really brave of you to come out here and share all this it must be tired hard to let others in on these feelings
anyone with depression or thoughts of suicide should get help families issues are tough and unfortunately i cant relate to your family problems but you could try some methods of communication not sure how close you are with them or if youve already done this but shoot them a phone call or email or even facebook any way for you to get closer to them cant be negative keep trying to get immigrated at this point its just a waiting game and dont do anything that you may remotely regret
this i lived this tired situation for three years no matter what they say they will do no matter the promises they make it will not get better i was pregnant and scared i had no friends never left our apartment i had no support system i understand loving him and wanting to make it work it wont though i had no education and didnt think i could leave i finally did though after he sexually assaulted me early one morning and it was the best thing i have ever done for myself and my kids its hard being alone and making it on my own but it is so much better than being controlled or manipulated like i was
honestly the first that that i feel when reading this is curiosity i see no reason for guilt but then my own experiences with it have shown me that it can be pretty irrationalive been suicidal for the past number days and the main reason for my pain has been doubt doubt that i could ever be good enough and i think that the first distinction to make is between being good enough for you and being good enough for others doubt also magnifies things so the reality of your concerns is most probably smaller than what you think still it takes distance from the pain for that to be helpfulafter all my experiences my goal is a pretty atypical existence but its one that would be good enough for me and i think that my pain pushed me from focusing on doing things for others to doing things for myself not in a selfish way but you are you and you are more or less the only person with the knowledge to figure out who you want to be and what you want to do be it with you whole life or the next five minuteshey just from the fact that your a sapient sentient being capable of the thought reason and capacity for emotion and pain that the writing of this post requires is a high enough standard for you to be good enough in my mindi highly doubt that even everything could be your fault and ive found that analysing my intentions and all the factors leading into the significant situations has given me enough of a conclusion to put most of those concerns to restmy biggest concern about me killing myself is that i dont think that anyone would remember me for who i really am only i know that i generally have little energy and thats why i drink a lot of lucozade after number days of suffering my drug of choice is an energy drink deliving glucosei also seriously doubt that youre ugly there are many resources online and off for dealing with such concerns but i also think that if youre capable of writing this post then youre not ugly your body is just a way of interfacing your mind with others some people are staticly beautiful nearly everyone is dynamically beautiful i nearly always try to avoid photos being taken of me because nearly all of them are bad but i know that i have a nice smile i just dont show through my body on cameraselfworth and selflove are tired large and complex things and its hard to know where to start but theyll be some for of existence that will be nuturing for you however atypical it isi think that the most important thing that i could recommend for you to do is to be able to live for you be the person that you want to be and do what you want to do its taken me years to be able to go off of my own desires and thoughts rather than others but it makes so much difference its your life other people dont own any part of itim available if you ever want to talk about things in detail i have a fair amount of experience with this matterid also recommend contacting a suicide hotline details relevant to where you live when things are really hard and especially before attempting anything i hope that at least some of this has helpedtldr whos awesome youre awesome
i found a great way to bring joy to my life was trying to bring joy to the people who have almost nothingmaybe you can find purpose and content and your life by helping out the people who have almost nothing maybe just donating your time or getting involved in programs for people i find one of the things that is so joyful is being there and bringing joy to someone who has almost nothing or much less than you getting started can be a bit intimidating but it is a true lifechanging experiencetake care and be well

so basically your life is boringit is extremely easy to want to you life is nothing more than a meaningless experiencebut the keyword is experiencelife is a one time experience there are two ways to view that experience one being that its meaningless in the end im going to die and nothing mattersthe other being ive got this one chance chance to experience things i havent been able towhen people go on vacation they dont go on vacation thinking the whole trip all this is going to endthey go on vacation wanting to enjoy every aspect of it before they do go homeyou need to realize that everybody in the world is on the same boat it is not just do that is going to die but all numbernumbernumbernumber people alive todaydoes that irritable mood we should quitokay most people who are in your situation dont care about that number billion you are one of thatbut there you go you live in a society that people hundred plus years ago wouldve given probably anything they could have to be a part of if they understood what was availablethe biggest problem seems to be your health in general i find people who are overweight to lose confidence in themselvesso obviously youre here for help there are many ways to solve your situation and it can be hard to be your own motivation but you should want to live to prove yourself wrong just hyperactive behavior millions of people do todayyou seem to have built a construct around having to have it typical life that normal is the only real way to live but i can assure you that that is not the case in the numberstcentury you dont have to get married you dont have to have kids you dont have to be overweigh you can have a plethora of hobbies whatever you hyperactive behaviorso i think its time you stop living your life for the people around you stop living your life to be a part of some normal statistic and start living your life for yourselfthis is a vacation you were nothing then you were alive and depending on your views of religion you will either be nothing again or youll go to heavenregardlessyou need to be around motivation you should want to live for yourself not because you should have a normal life but because you can have whatever life you wantyoure exhaustion of television and video games stop doing them you have conditioned yourself to be lazy and it can be hard to break that but your brain is designed to release chemicals into your body when it finds something stimulating laziness keeps you from getting those chemicals chemicals hyperactive behavior dopamine to make you happy dopamine is also in control of movementwhich is why people who work out can get really happy doing so takes a while but it can fight mental depression sadnessi would advise you to not consider death an option because your lifestyle makes you unhappy your philosophy on how to be happy makes you unhappythe girl you loved stimulated that stimulation released chemicals in your brain without anything to make you happy without anything to stimulate you you were going to be depressedbut it takes your sheer will to not have these chemicals control your life depression is a hypothermia natural response from your body to do something i think you need physical stimulationi want you to understand this once again its not your conscious or your soul that just feels hopeless its the lack of proper chemicals that make you feel bad thats with mental depression medicine is trying to fill the void and i cant fill the void because it the gaps are too big because you are using that medicine to be the only thing to stimulate youyoure literally letting chemicals ruin your life depression makes you lazybut fortunate for you youre given the opportunity to understand thismy advice to you would be this get yourself a gym membership you may feel embarrassed but that goes away its just a response dont watch tv or get video games go out and do things do things with real people it doesnt matter how old you are and you should never let embarrassment a chemical response it is only to protect you from danger which is abnormal behavior and unnecessary control youbeing able to stimulate yourself will make the biggest difference in your life just doing things doesnt irritable mood thats all it is doing things releases chemicals in your brain movement releases dopamine activities that are laborintensive released dopamine you being lazy is nothing more than a responsebut as i said dont hyperactive behavior chemicals control you use them to your benefit stay on your mental depression medicine and use the share will all of us have to understand that you are not dictated to your body your body is dictated by you you need to be stimulated and there a lot of fun things you can do but you got to be the one to play yourself out of the whole you can be happy you just got to take the first step and not let the lack of chemicals control youlove is nothing more than a chemical remember that true love is intellectual love humans get drug abuse the chemicals and now its time for you to find a new way to get a dopamine and other necessary chemicals to improve your psychological health the first steps are working out and maybe fixing your diet a little bitits your callif you kill yourself you dont let not your intellectual mind win but some stupid chemicals that influence your mood wintake care and feel free to leave another comment or anything youd hyperactive behavior me to clarify on im here for youthere to them being numbernumber am i used speech to text software its not flawless so if you come across any awkward typos that you can figure out let me knowtake care
shit thats a really dark hole youve found yourself in i can see how it seems like theres really no other way out can you think of anything at all that would make your situation even just a little bit better
seriously shes not worth it no matter how much it hurts your life is worth far more than any relationship hang in there and there will be other women in future no woman is ever worth losing your life to
no not really the second therapist a little but not enough
i make just enough money to get by not a lot extra for doctors i already pay number session for my psych and a lot of therapists dont take my insurance i graduated from a school in nebraska
my boyfriend and i travel for our jobs so there are periods where ill have the entire place to myself or be in another state alone it works out and relieves a lot of the tension that comes from living together and being around each other constantlynni dont like living alone ive always had a roommate or boyfriend to live with i can related numbernni hate the sound of my own name so ive actually changed it legally but my family refuses to call me by my new name and it strikes me painfully every time i hear it i dont know why i hated my birth name so much but its always been a problem for me since i was a childnnmy friends dont take me seriously either and tell me to grow up when i have breakdowns because the things im breaking down about are apparently not legitimate or seriousnni have no advice to you for self acceptance because its something i struggle with even with therapy but youre not alone
you are young its hard to go out and finally get out lives started be patient and stay focused im trying to get a job too and its difficult different country tho but you just need to keep trying perseverance will bring results eventually probably once that happens you will start feeling better about yourself and that will definitely help to make relationships with the people around you better talk to your girlfriend you feeling like this is probably affecting her and the way she acts around you too i dont know how i would act if i found my boyfriend with a gun in his hand either tell her how you feel and ask her to help you stay motivated to do all the things you wanna do im sure you can make it
who cares whether its of use to anyone else if it has value to you then it has valueif youre talking about economic value then thats a different matter then its about creating things that have enough value to other ppl that they will pay you for them you can find what those things are then learn them which youre already doing by working you are providing value to the world ie some useful service or product which is why your company pays you but as for things you care about things have value simly because people ascribe value to them if you paint a picture you hyperactive behavior then it has value because you give it value if someone else doesnt hyperactive behavior it thats too bad but it doesnt detract from its value in your eyes if you enjoy doing something and other people dont who cares it doesnt make you enjoy it less maybe you love camping and everyone else cant stand it but that doesnt stop you enjoying camping and getting pleasure from it
your brother is watching over you he would not want you to leave this earth before your time has been called believe me ive learned this the hard way
i just got some hope after reading this i dont know if i can be as brave as you are but ill try my best thanks
dont kill yourself op right now you have something to live for even if you dont win your daughter that doesnt mean that you cant ever visit her you should ask the judge that if you lose that you at least can keep track of her and that youll be the numbernd parent if where she lives right now turns out too bad and if you cant ever visit her you can tell her when she turns number what a bitch her mom was your feeling angry and pain would probably have calmed down by then but it gives you a goal
this is the worst kind of pressure anyone can deal with straight up your mother was wrong and extraordinarily selfish in telling you that the only reason the marriage was holding up was because of you coming from a divorced family though i will say i can understand why she did that she was feeling hopeless and alone and needed some kind of rock in a storm unfortunately you ended up being the rock a fear of failure is totally justified but failure is the best way to learn in life because youre able to process what happened and how youre able to fix it much faster than if you read about it in a book or from another third party people do say that collegeuni can be life changing but some of us myself included are just late bloomers ive been in a community college for number years now and im only just now finding things im passionate about if i were to focus only on what i assumed people expected of me i would have been a totally different person than i am today your body is a complex piece of equipment and if you feel this downtrodden have you considered seeing your schools psychologist you can give a pseudo name if it makes you more comfortable and its usually much more affordable than someone off campus your parents no matter what want you to be happy and healthy more than anything have you considered talking to them about this pressure you feel im sure it would help you get a good stance as to where you should go from there
i didnt graduate from drug abuse school in fact i dropped out halfway through my senior year i was a year behind and couldnt stomach the thought of another year and being in the same grade as my younger brother and sister twins i also have adhd anxiety problems depression the usual cocktail generally people hyperactive behavior us are of higher than average intelligence however the system specifically schools set us up for failure rrim number years old now and even though that was a very difficult embarrassing time for me college was different i went to a community college got my ged and went on to a number year school eventually now im in a career i love i started making six figures at number years old and my pay grade is equivalent to a full colonel in the us military gsnumber i realize that doesnt irritable mood much to you unless your parents or a family member is a government employee but for a kid that failed and dropped out of drug abuse school to rise to the level im at and achieve the things ive achieved is a major major victoryrri know things seem hopeless i have been in your shoes i also know this will sound clichxcnumberxanumber but it gets better college is easier for us adhd folks we can choose classes and a majors that interest us and you know as well as i do when were interested in something focusing becomes very easy the problem is hyperactive behavior focus then haha getting our attention on other things becomes problematic rrdo whatever you have to do to make it through this year if you can work out a plan to graduate things will be easier if not a ged will get you into many state schools and all number year schools from which you can transfer to a number year collegeuniversity find a major you love pour yourself into it and you will succeed try and ignore the haters including family they dont understand they cant understand your brain and brain chemistry is fundamentally different from theirs in form and function rrif you give up they win if you beat the odds swallow your pride take your lumps and succeed despite the odds and what anyone says you win we all win hang in there i irritable mood it when i say say it gets better
what is it tell me all about it
the only thing that can make this situation as bad as you really see it is if you completely give up you are clearly smart and you are clearly talented and whether or not you can pay rent in a couple months will not change that your family loves you because you are those things and they will always be more proud of your accomplishments than they will be disappointed in your setbacks life is scary as shit just remember that you can do whatever you want you just got to commit you have put a lot of effort into school maybe its time to see the world or something or move a new place i dont know even when it feels like there arent any options there definitely are
i dunno im just really exhaustion not up to talking much now ive been sleeping a lot more recently gotta try and get myself back on track
thats basically what ive been doing for the last number years or so i manage to distract myself for a few months get my hopes up that if i can just do xyz ill be alright i always end up in the same place though so i guess i would say i can relate good programmerare you talking about hyperactive behavior a computer programmer
its not about finding the right path its about finding a path i can actually follow i know what i have to do roughly but for lack of a better term i just dont want to do it its almost like i want to stay this way its all ive known for the past number years and seeing as i clearly dont have what it takes to end it im afraid its all i will ever know
you keep going back to the docs until you find a medication that worksit takes time and strength and i wish you the best
go for it and good luck
the way things work is just stupid the less you look hyperactive behavior you need help the more likely people are to be there for you its incredibly frustrating im really glad i found this community this post has helped me more than all my friends combined its good to have people who can relate that you can talk to its a damn good feeling to be there for someone and have someone be there for you
this is beautiful i often think of the happy face i put on for others as a mask too id love for you to share your other poems
nah man its no problem haha you should definitely follow that thread of the person from your group therapy they sound hyperactive behavior theyd be a great person for you to relate to and who knows maybe theyre looking for the same thing and yes youre right its probably a good idea to hold off on dating until youre sure youre ready of course it can be a fun thing to follow and think about in times of sadness though
well i can think of one thing assuming you pay for these things yourself including the smokes you can come clean on smoking when you go home you are at home alotting time is not that important you are only there as much as you will share anyway that is about the limit of my suggestions i also do not have faiths banding me to attaching myself to life or fear of death i see some major issues that a great number of people either simply overlook or are complacent with not knowing what to do with it so at the very least hello also absurdismurl
just dont kill yourself you have something to live for your cat just imagine what it would be like to her if her best friend wouldnt be there anymore she couldnt stand this so just dont do it
ah in that case i will play the bastard for a moment you are on suicide watch and concerned about your mum knowing you smoke weed think about that which has more clout your mom catches you with a pain localised and berates you or your mom walks in and finds your corpse which is more daunting a prospectgiven you are in college right now you are emplyed which is a damn sight more successful than many i know and you are not yet dead as for what you mentioned about your friends working a highschool job have you ever gone to your local shop and seen a numbersomething year old man working behind the counter who is obviously unwell and working to survive and thought about how your mother might catch you unwell this world is shit man i wont disagree but these reasons can be resolved in a short space of time when your fees are covered you get to live separate from your parents as your friends are making themselves their own lives and you your own you can spend time getting to know yourself and make new friends short of being in a constant risk of no prospects i think you are in a bad place right now for you though even with a constant depression things can get better
you know that does sound appealing a white room is appealing because it is devoid of all sensory input you want this because you are dissatisfied with something it would provide the ultimate opportunity to rest for people to me and you death is not that room death is the room at which all is black and your thoughts are forever frozen no future existence of them is guaranteed though it is possible i often go for walks or skis when it is snowing it is tired like that white room i imagine a beautiful place i believe in you
carry her to the next car and drive her to the hospital if you are not stron enough ask fneightbours to help you or just call number
hi so last night i was sitting on the ledge of my window contemplating whether or not i should jump my dad had just choked me and told me that i should get out of the house and earlier he had called me a bum to me it seemed as though there was no reason to keep living the people that are supposed to care about you the most dont but one thing echoed in my mind and that was something one of my best friends had told me you dont help yourself and reading through your post made me feel like thats also the case for you maybe instead of cutting things out add some things into your life go outside take a deep breath and talk to somebody new i dont know your financial situation but if you can take lessons join a gym take classes the most important thing is you do something for you be a little selfish take yourself out to eat in your favorite restaurant once in a while try some new food but do something if you do read this please know a lot of people feel pain youre not alone number
it sounds hyperactive behavior we have similar experiences and personalitiy types ive done a lot of self reflecting a lot a lot my philosophy perspective and personality have all improved by leaps and bounds since the break up the most profound moment was a month in when i realized and sympathized with why she chose to leave me like you said i was a depressed mood boyfriend in certain ways i always did the best that i could but over the years i became complacent and my insecurity and sadness made me selfish i really chest pain her i realized that i broke her heart long before she broke minethe odds of us having a relationship again are slim to none she lives number hours away from me and is top in her class at one of the most prestigious universities in the world im a drug abuse school drop out and deliver pizzas shes in a serious relationship with a girl and has moved onill reply to everything as long as there are things to reply to i dont know what i will do today or tomorrow if there is a tomorrow answersnumber she may agree to speak with me but really all a conversation hyperactive behavior that will do is cause her anxiety flashbacks and pain it would distance her from me even more our last communication was number months ago today actually i wrote her a long letter validating her decision after i fully embraced why she needed to do what she did but she firmly stands by her decision i wish i could talk to her about this i wish it would irritable mood somethingnumber not a lot i skipped school a lot in drug abuse school and just sat alone in my room messing around on the internet she saw something in me that no one else had ever tried to see and she made an effort to get to know me without her i would have killed myself years agonumber ive always wanted to travel and see the world ive always wanted to pursue acedemia at a university i always wanted to inspire othersto make a positive impact
you probably wont care for a while it happens to all of us but this kind of things dont ask for your permission they just happen you are young youll find someone else and if not someone else will find you relationships are crazy like that when one ends we lose faith in them but then another one starts youll be ok and if you get your life in order and feel good about who you are youll find someone that fits perfectly into your new life it takes time but it just suddenly happens
all of those things can ultimately be fixed except the last one dont do it even if you want to do it guns are not the way to go there are much less horrific ways not least if you react at the last second and miss youd be surprised how often that happens survival instinct seriously its not worth it as i said jobs and friends can be replaced faces cant be put back together sorry to be so graphic take a deep breath remember the good things sunlight in a forest kittens smell of a bbq on a hot day feeling sand between your toes on the beach things you used to enjoy that sort of stuff remember moods come and go all the time hyperactive behavior clouds never make permanent decisions based on your current mental state which is subject to change

life does seem pointless and cruel doesnt it but so is just dying and sleeping forever i wont try to cheer you up because you dont needs cheering you have a decision that only you can make and that decision is either a living this crappy life and expecting great things to come from but ultimately falling short or b ending it all and not knowing what will happen next but be social fear of the thought until you ultimately meet your end anyways regardless life sucks death sucks but what can we as humans do about it death is as important as living and living your life to fulfil whatever purpose you have here is just as important too until the day comes dont stop living just keep going and when he comes to get you one day just remember you have a job to do not just in life but in death as well because in the end thats just the cycle we live now for my story i wont get into it because ive yet to decide what my decision is but i hope you find peace in whatever your decision may be
ahh im in south asia i dont know any good doc in north carolina but ill ask my teacher if they know any good psychologist there dont worry were all with you
we can talk to you instead on here if thats any use reddit is always available except during downtime of course whats been happening are you up for talking a bit we might be able to help or at least listen to you
i do this too i imagine it often but i have zero intention of ever going through with it its just calming to imagine it as much as i hate myself i dont want to die
i think she cares for youand you are most welcome i would have loved to even just have helped a bit it means a lot to me to mean a lot to someone else what a sentenceim wondering how did you go from latvia to cambridge and what does helsinki have to do with all this
i wonder a lot but the wondering is about things that dont exactly encourage what one would label positive thinking mostly about morality and the hyperactive behavior and about how death is a in an abstract sense a diety within its own right but thinking doesnt make me any happier i have medicine and it levels me out some but it also changes my thinking im not as sad but it dulls other emotions too
not my first love but thanks for trying to help no just get home a sleep in the bathroom because i cant stand my family and no with her i cant stand anyone l i shut the lights and lay there to pretend im dead its a lot simpler to just do it
been on prozac paxil but currently on efexorxr numbermg im at a good point not depression not stuck in the tunnel theres other options this is just the one that i deem best for me considering everything
precisely its good that you take notes good to read when becoming uncertain of what to saykeep in mind that questions may be asked to you be ready for expected and perhaps unexpected questions if they seem hostile in some way its probably because they dont thoroughly understand be as understanding to them as you wish them to be for you good luck to you
i dont think its that people are afraid of dying i believe its because people are afraid of what may or may not be on the other sideplus a lot of people would rather have a painless death so i guess some are afraid of the possible pain some may be even afraid of attempting but failing and ending up brain dead or something
im interested since youve pretty much described my life im a guy so not so many men willing to have sex with me but the emptinessfriends of obligation is tired familiar id tired much like to hear more of your story

im really tired of sharing my story with so many people on the internet i hope youll be the last person and ill put myself out of this misery im a number year old male from india when i was a kid just like any other kid i was immensely attached to my parents specially to my dad he meant the world to me when i was tired tired young my parents started having problems in their relationship i didnt know the reason but a time came when my mother decided to leave and take me with her she found a job secretly and took me away but things went bad she couldnt get the job she was hoping for she was broke she told me she is going to leave me at my dads house and find a job and come and pick me up in number months i didnt understand why dad had another house when she left me at his door and i went in it hit me he was already married with a daughter number years older than me i stayed there for number and a half years in these two and a half years i was harassed by my step sister i was scared to even use the washroom when i needed and urinated myself she told everyone that i was a thief she used to talk about my mom insultingly it was pain but not something i couldnt handle what broke me was my dads response to all this till that day i was his darling and then suddenly he stopped bothering about me he believed whatever his daughter had to say never believed me being ditched by the person i loved the most was extremely pain i was around number years old when all this happened its tired traumatic i dont even remember a lot of detailsafter number years i got out of that hell i started living with my mom and my dad provided all the financial needs but he never loved me he used to show all his frustration from work and outside world with my mom he didnt treat us like a legitimate family he didnt give us any dignity for the outside world he was not my father i never had any friends at school from numberth class to numberth class i was tired badly bullied after that i slowly started recovering i became this model guy to everyone around me wise intelligent ambitious all that shit but i was alone broken in the inside just waiting to explode and last year i met this girl not somebody i would consider good looking but i fell in love with her she held my hand and took my heart se was the first person i shared my story to i thought finally my life is about to see some happiness but it didnt last even for a couple of days i loved her immensely she didnt she was bipolar she gets angry at me destroys me breaks me and once in a while tired rarely she gives me some love she keeps me far away from her im the least of her priorities she has a boyfriend whom shes gonna leave with im just there on the side when she needs me i cant let go of her because she has suffered a lot in life i dont want her to suffer and be there to make sure she is happy there were times when she kept me away for a couple of months and it was hell i cant stay away from her she will come to me only when she wants me otherwise im a disturbance to her sleep now probably youll just give me advice to leave her and find the love that i deserve thats what she also tell me to find the love i deserve the thing is im tired of this world where people cant even love im done with this
sometimes you just get that little headbutt from your kitty and thats enough i know that feeling it sounds like the spasm have been tired pain for you i cant imagine what its like to have them that seems tired scary to me are there people who you talk to in your life that know about the spasm like i said it sounds tired scary to me and like something that would be tired difficult to deal with on your own im concerned about your wellbeing
dont think that youre alone therere a lot of people out there for you may you stay happy
sharing a piece of my mind doesnt solve any problemsnothing can solve this problem really i am helpless
as a bpd myself my thoughts on this are that most people in the medical field especially nondoctors worked for their special number or number year degree in helping people so they can feel accomplished themselves these people are good at school thorough competent with positive outlooks who usually have no idea how to be truly compassionate the ones who make it through school most of the time with a tough time get out and have a little more compassion or are truly just blessed with seeing the world in someone elses shoes and understanding its not often you come across medical proffesionals like this most of them dont get past the helping people part in their mind when they are number applying for college they go in with the mindset im a normal person so i can just help all the crazy people by just being normal around them
hey you i wanna be your penpal im male number years old and had a mental depression if its over yet for around one year and now im feeling way better and id hyperactive behavior to help others because some help would have been awesome number
we just gotta do it one day at a time take care of today no need to anxiety about a made up future
dont i dont think your boyfriend would break up with you have faith in him i think you need to get yourself some time off work to deal with this dont ever give up on yourself go home and be with your family with people who truly love and care for you youre not cheap or dirty because of those assholes never blame yourself for their crime i think you really need to go home for a while and be with your family
yeah um your friend doesnt sound like much of one do you still have feelings for her if so hanging out with her would be just painful so it may be best to just let her go for nowin terms of work i am unemployed with the ability to find a job and am struggling to find the ambition to seek what i could easily get i understand your apathy to finding work i keep saying im going to reach out and find a job tomorrow the day after one of these days ill get it done and ill be off my butt im sure you could use graduation as a time to propel yourself to apply for what you wantwhen i feel like this sometimes the best thing to do is to move across the country to another city whatever change your life if youre not happy with it moving is so easy these days i vote against moving home with those controlling parents i also vote against the military youve got lots of options with a degreegood luck dude
