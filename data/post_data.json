harder than anything theyll ever experience thats something to take pride inwell i wish you the best you can break up the tedium in time but finding the point of your life is something youll have to

accusations of racism and management just swallowed it i got suspended for a asthenia and now i have some tired ugly stuff in my file i begged them to at least investigate but they jsut accepted it at

hours maybe numbernumber days i dont knowrrhere are the facts im unhappy and abnormally exhaustion and ive been that way for the past several years frequently alternating between a notsobad and very depressed mood state i dont remember much about drug abuse school and college so far beside being exhaustion i am also obsessed with the idea of killing myself i think about suicide several times a day since over a yearrrthankfully im the kind of person who can succeed in school without much effort so ive managed to make it through drug abuse school with excellent grades and make it to college in a challenging but interesting program called science letters and artsrrhowever a few months ago the situation started to worsen and my grades began to drop sharply to the point where ill likely have to quit this program im so exhaustion that im no longer very functional i wake up in the morning arrive late at school try stay wakefulness in class return home do nothing hypersomnia on some days i just skip classrri have lost all interest in everything i used to have so many passions interest and hobbies that it drove me to choose the science letters and arts program in college now i have no interest whatsoever in even the most mundane thingsrri have lost pretty much all hope of curing my mental depression state i think its part of me it makes me more lucid it makes me see the

poison my existence im disillusioned about liferri have a lot of friends and several close friends who support me some of them pushed me to get help which i tried to do to no avail i have no family doctor so ive been to clinics without appointments but all they tell me is eat well hypersomnia more i went to a clsc a place where you can get health services for free public healthcare ftw and im currently on a waiting list to get an appointment with a psychologist and a doctor because i think there might be a physical cause for my mental illbeing i think i did the best i could but this is going nowhere in the meanwhile i cant live with myself anymorerrits a coincidence that im alive today if ever i commit suicide it wont be one of those failed callforhelp attempts and my suicide was planned so it wouldnt fail i should have killed myself yesterday as initially planned but i went out with friends and came back home later that planned so i decided after much thought that i was too exhaustion to kill myself that night also i think i should write a suicide note but i was too exhaustion to write one todayrrwhat led me to postpone my suicide plans for today is the futile and slight

point is you probably wouldnt be alone or unloved for very long if youre wife is really going to move on then you are certainly just as capable life is all together to short most good guys will always love the mother of their children my point is if you love her then you should want for her to be happy as the father of her children she should want the same move on im sorry if thats too blunt or bordering on tough love but if your relationship isnt salvageable and one of you isnt interested in making it work and fixing the broken wagon wheel theres really nothing else for you to do then is thereim not going to disclose my life to you but i will say this and i might get in trouble for it if this was a lawless world id save you the trouble and assume your identity sorry if thats a bit

treat you lithium and lamictal for instance dont take this as gospel but i believe they will ask you whether you have a plan and so long as you say no ie its just passing thoughts with no firm plans

sometimes they do some biological testsnot exactly as strong as you put it im asking if it influenced or tipped your ideas as to what might be going on if you were looking for that ive talked with

back to school if thats really not what you want i value education a lot but university is not going to work for everyone i do think that itd give you something to live for though and that you

and all that it was and would be compared with the amount of pain that i was in and it took me to that last moment to change my mind to try and bear the pain a little longer in the hopes that it would eventually stop your survival instinct is a lot stronger that you think that it would be and you need that control to do anything with that knowledge that just how much is better than nothingmy primary objective everyday is just to survive whatever it takes and so i spend my time distracting myself immersing myself in enough multitasking that i dont feel the pain as muchid also ask that you contacted a suicide hotline details of which are specific to where you live and before suicide exaust every other method of dealing with chronic pain whatever helps lessen the pain is probably better

them like a vacuum they have a limited size gravitational field and masses outside of that field are unaffected what i mean is a black hole will not simply pull all objects towards it only the ones within the reach of its gravitational force furthermore wikipedia states in number stephen hawking showed that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiationnumber he got this result by applying quantum field theory in a static black hole background the result of his calculations is that a black hole should emit particles in a perfect black body spectrum this effect has become known as hawking radiation since hawkings result many others have verified the effect through various methodsnumber if his theory of black hole radiation is correct then black holes are expected to emit a thermal spectrum of radiation and thereby lose mass because according to the theory of relativity mass is just highly condensed energy e mcnumbernumber black holes will shrink and evaporate over time the temperature of this spectrum hawking temperature is proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole which for a schwarzschild black hole is inversely proportional to the mass large black holes therefore emit less radiation than small black holesso black holes dont last forever they actually lose mass over time furthermore given the length of time we have until our sun becomes a red giant and the earth becomes uninhabitable humans have a large fighting chance of being able to populate habitable planets surrounding other stars if life is designed to perpetuate life through means of natural selection as well as through survival during celestial travel via panspermiaurl as well as through the eventual evolution of cognitive function which grows into scientific reasoning and technological advances eventually leading into a species gaining the ability to inhabit other worlds then the destruction of our solar system will not mark the end of life it may mark the end of humans theres no way to tell but i can tell you confidently that we wont take it lying down when species compete with each other to adapt and be the fittest for survival the real winner is always biodiversity for earths biosphere as a whole a variety of species in many areas living many different ways increases the likelihood of life continuing in any form by reducing the risk of any single catastrophic event occurringi guess my point is that life will strive to continue and singularities dont last forever if you follow the big bounce theory then all mass and energy would continue to exist following the next big bang should the universe return to a singularity once more there is a point to our lives as humans and we will continue to struggle to claim our place in the

you do when youre trying to end a conversation by getting near the door or turning slightly to the side i might be wrong they might also just be social fear about moving on to wherever or whatever and

homo sapiens have surpassed themselves over and over again throughout their existence the species does not stop toiling in its growth for my grand hopes or your bleak existential questioning rather it utilizes these ideas to bolster its rapid acceleration of ability and the scope of its influence i believe humanity it can still be called humanity at that point will do things unimaginable by the likes of you or me as it has a billion times previous colonization of other planets is not so far out of our grasp as to warrant the need to invoke faith i take it almost as fact that we can accomplish something as small as relocation of our speciesterraforming too is something i find small potatoes in the grand scheme of human invention and achievement look at the world around you we have practically covered the surface of our planet with an asphalt mesh of roads we have dammed rivers created lakes and cleared forests soon we may colonize the moon which is little more than a dusty rock ball that happens to have a few icewater caches within its craters i consider theres a chance that our species will ultimately be wiped out just as i consider theres a chance that when i compete i will be destroyed by those better than me that when i leave my house i will get mowed down by a careless vehicle etc however this does not stop me from striving to achieve my goals anyway and i want you to know that ignorance regarding the point of our existence is no excuse for not continuing said existence we may not matter to the universe but as far as i can tell nothing does the only being that cares about my existence is other humans around me i wont exist in number years ill bet but that doesnt mean that there is no meaning to the lifetime i find myself occupying nowfrom what i can gather of you you have a thirst for knowledge i daresay discovering new ideas of the world makes you happyyou say yourself that you would have ended it long ago if not for your endeavors in knowledge i want to ask you have you ever tried living for another person have you recently sought to gain happiness by providing joy to another i myself tired much enjoy gaining scientific knowledge but i find making others happy and the pursuit of flow the state of ones skill level meeting ones challenge the things that make me the most happy i also gain great pleasure from stories relating to the trials of a character and his achievements hopes and failuresi can try to prescribe these activitys for you but if the pursuit of knowledge is truly what can stimulate action from you if it gives you a reason to act and to have goals and to watch yourself achieve them then perhaps you could try to live your life furthering humanitys understanding of the universe you also have a penchant for philosophy which is ultimately the school of thought that your ideas lie in merely borrowing from physics to explain them maybe you could try to find your solution within philosophical textsmy point is that you have a capable brain and i judge you as being far from unimportant both to our species and to myself the universe cannot disagree as unfortunately for it it has no means to our species knowledge of observing our existencei want you to know that i responded to your post because it stimulated my mind and not because i had the need to stop you from dying your existence has meaning with me for a quality you are lucky to possess not just because you are another faceless member of humanity and i have some broad sweeping principle idea that no humans should commit suicide your existence holds meaning with me and with others and so i bid you temporarily excuse its lack of meaning with you and the universeif you commit suicide now it will be too late i already have felt your existence affect my life and because of that your own existence will have a hand in shaping my future existence which will shape the existence of many others inanimate or not you cannot stop yourself from having existed only from continuing to exist you lost the chance to not affect the rest of universe during conception and now you have no choice but to continue affecting it one way or another that said i challenge you to the pointless task of living a full life and going out in a blaze of beautiful glory having positively touched the lives of many others just as you have already touched my own and having achieved a goal that holds a grand measure of importance to you you say that you cannot commit suicide until you are sure that it is the answer and i say that just because you or i cannot know the point of our existence does not mean that there is not one i say that until you experience the the wonder of pure joy resulting from having filled another with joy that until you have achieved something that is important to the unique individual human being that is you that until you have lived a tired fulfilled existence that you cannot accurately judge whether there is a point to it or not at alli leave the rest up to you i have given you my surest reasoning as to the point of continued existence and you have the choice of believing it or denying it and nitpicking at my interpretation in order to fulfill the world view you have previously indicated you have or fear may be true of the universe or you can simply take a small part or two of what i have said and use it

until that new insert filmgamebookalbumnew thing comes out and then ill do it theres always been something but there always hasnt been anything after the last thingfrom my knowledge and experience suicide is an extreme response to extreme pain and so the way to deal with it is to remove or at the least lessen the pain that is after all the general reason behind suicide its just that all other options should be thoroughly exausted firsti try to distract myself immerse myself in things try and feel as good as i still can suicide is on the horizon but theres something nice thats more immediate the ways of dealing with that kind of pain is rather specific to the individual but i game a lot as a distraction i immerse myself in reading books watching films or shows listening to music

up you mind with nice stuff it stops the pain for a whileid also recommend trying to meet new people something where continued contact is worth hanging around for ive found a certain kind of

in terms of their train of thought what i want to do is help people to see that happiness is not just something to dream of its completely possible to have theres no formula that fits everyone some

disappointed in you do you irritable mood to tell me they would not be disappointed in you if you committed suicide the first step of conquering these feelings is to do it with people who care about you if you think that they would be upset with you confronting them about a matter that is so serious then you are wrongi had a cousin who thought the same exact thing is as you he didnt want to burden his family or his friends with his suicidal thoughts he did end up killing himself and we were all absolutely astonished by the fact that he made no effort to talk to us about it because we would have been there for himand now we are much more disappointed than we ever could have been if he would have confronted us with this matter then due to the fact that he decided to avoid us and kill himselfi want to make this clear suicide awareness is much more present today than its ever been and people understand the importance of helping people who feel that its an answeryou are worth

you have a potential to enjoy life which trumps a logical analysis of wanting or not wanting you dont choose to live nobody did but we discover who we can be as a result and whether we find difficulty there that can be seen as completely separate its okay to be in trouble and in need of help its human and common and normal if you are here for others then maybe its not so much to ask of yourself to try anything that will work to help yourself up it can be difficult to believe in yourself but its possible its always possible to move on from where we are and there is no shame in that", "well i

girl i liked and ended up stabbing me in the back by lying about it thats the kind of person he is i know that i am better than him because i would never do that yet he did is that the kind of person i am no so maybe its better that i am who i am because i know that when i do find that someone and trust me even i know i will despite the fact that i tell myself i am going to be alone forever i will be the best possible person for that woman because of what i have gone through what i have learned about myself you may be desperate but desperation has only one direction as far as im concerned and that direction is up if you are low enough to be desperate than you cant fall any further just tell yourself that you arent going to be down in that desperation zone forever but it doesnt happen over

to be happy why dont you actively do something about it you say society and people fuck it upwhich to an extent i believe as well but after a certain point you have to say fuck that and take matters into your own weakness of hand societys depressing it truly is people are shitty at times but you cant control society or other people but you can control yourself you can control how you deal with situations and you can control if youre feeling lazy and unmotivated if you want advice i really feel that rewiring how you think will help in psychology cbt is a thing its cognitive behavioral therapy and its based on the belief that if you change a patients thinking pattern and self talk their behavior will change its so easy to give up and if you have that mindset that nothing matters then your actions are going to follow that but if you wake up every morning and slowly change your thought process this sucks i dont want to do this to yes this sucks but if i complete this task it

also tired tired tired bad the place and colleagues make such a difference pay is also really really shit at first but eventually tired good although it seems impossible to get there my first job didnt pay enough for me to qualify for tax most of the time in it you move on the next place and get a pay rise they tend to reward moving and getting experience of working at different places than promoting within an organisation so youve got that if you can just carry on at the place then switch that should work in theory the it people i see on low wages seem to be the ones who stay at the

selfcentered and in your note today that you are selfish im going to have to disagree with you on that one too the problem bizarrely is that you are not selfish or selfcentered enough let me

lonely sometimes if their children have grown up and moved away etc or theyve lost a partner spending time with the old guysgirls could be worth a shot and although maybe not what youre looking for old people do have younger kids in their families so you could meet an old person then get invited round and meet younger people in the end yes i know how bad this sounds not that old people arent good enough i know this is a bit of a complicated plan but it could work really well old people may have gone through all sorts of stuff in their lives so may be really understanding and a real support for you having said that ive met some really selfrighteous who are old d to start that though you could just ask if theyve got kids i suppose like asking is there anyone else for dog to play

mom brother and sisteri have had those exact same thoughts and feelings thankfully i havent in about a year but for me those thoughts generally creep in and out for me it was actually a little comforting when i knew that i didnt want to deal with what i had going at least i still knew that there were people around me that still depended on me thats the best way i could word it it me helped marginally but it didnt really make me feel any better i still felt entirely alone and very anxioushonestly i dont fear death at allthis is something that i can also empathize with not in that bad ass action hero kind of way but more in the way that contemplating my own death causes no appropriate feelings of discomfortone thing i have found that helps me and im posting it in hopes that it might help you too is taking things slowly taking things in stride i just live one day at a time and stop worrying about what will happen tomorrow my situation is a bit different than yours but this method might help you out a bit too you said that you are getting really nausea and exhaustion of fighting your mental illness it might help if you just slow down your thinking i imagine and hopefully im not wrong that you have your good days and your bad days make the most out of your good days dont anxiety about what kind of day tomorrow will be deal with that day when it comes on your bad days just do what you have to do to deal with that day and remember the good daysdespite having had thoughts similar to yours ive never gone to seek any counseling for me this has been okay but i wouldnt recommend this for everyone my point is this i have never gone to any professional counseling because im anxiety of being labeled with a disease i know that if i am then it will forever change how i view myself id start to feel as if i were broken im going to guess by that fact that you said that you have bipolar disorder ii and not just bipolar disorder that you have been diagnosed by a psychologist or psychiatrist halfway into this thought and i just realized that it is really not going the direction i intended but please read on its really important to not label yourself as broken or diseased my original point despite the fact that it really came out the wrong way at first is that this is definitely easier to say than it is to do since this is the first thing you talked about it appears that this might be what you let define you i hope im wrong but it seems that you feel hyperactive behavior you are these diseases you are not these diseases the diseases are words that doctors must use so that insurance companies will cover your medication that is all you are simply a number year old female college student that is coping with some traumatic life events in the best way you know how dont devalue yourself by limiting your personal image of yourself to what the dsm says you appear to be a person of value to your family and friends and im sure they would be happy to reiterate that

overwhelming and im starting to accept them and i know that if life takes one more thing from me im going to act on them if i dont just act on it randomly one dayif you pay attention you may notice that all of the suicidal inclinations originate within the mind namely from the thoughts have you ever wondered where these thoughts come from these thoughts seem foreign dont they indeed they come to us from our spiritual enemies the demons who hate mankind with perfect malice the demons are able to transmit thoughts to us as if shooting arrows or casting poisonous darts the thoughts are the weapons they use against us the demons compass about us swarming upon us refusing to leave us alone they obtain power over us because to some degree we share in their darknessthey are spiritual parasites who steal energy from us by inciting negative emotions via the transmission of thoughts to the intellect which is a part of the human soul these thoughts incite hatred anger jealousy lust greed all kinds of negativity their ultimate goal is to destroy us when they attack often like piranhas on a feeding frenzy the human heart becomes overwhelmed with despair despondency fear anger resentment and a distraught psychological state that is difficult to escape from and recognizable by its effectswhen these evil thoughts are accepted the thought enters into the heart where it spawns an emotion that is a feeling with which the thought joins and the combination of the negative thought with a negative feeling tends to effect one or two things it will either produce an action or a desireinclination to perform that same actionif you have never followed through with the action then the effect is a desireinclination to perform the action and the action itself is easier to resist however once you begin accepting the thoughts which will assault us repeatedly it becomes increasingly difficult to resist the inclinationdesire to perform the resulting actionits spiritual warfare we must resist the demons when we accept their lies it gives them greater power over us day after day they come to us and inject thoughts into the mind designed to cause despair selfhatred hopelessness etc then they will tell you to kill yourself and they will come and attack you again and again for days weeks months and years they know it will wear a person down if they are relentless they may relent temporarily if it helps their cause if they see us doing things that harm us like using drugs but they are simply lying in wait like wolves if someone begins to believe the lies the demons tell them in their thoughts the demons weaken us and they become stronger feeding off the despair or whatever negative emotionsactions they incite demons seek to conquer a person in small steps if they seek your destruction via suicide they will start small making you feel like an economicacademicsocial failure not good enough ugly unlikable etc things to make us feel bad about ourselves unloved and hopeless among these smaller steps the demons try to get you to start cutting yourself or burning sensation yourself banging your head against the wall punching the wall breaking things once you start hurting yourself following through on the desireaction that is produced by the acceptance of the thought into the heart then it becomes harder and harder to resist the actions they seek and the behavior begins to hard wire itself into the brain where it becomes a behavioral pattern for example if you live in a number story house you can run up and down the stairs tired fast without thinking about it its become a hard wired action another example people who become addicted to smoking can have a streamlined behavior pattern a thought to smoke automatic acceptance of the thought into heart and desire and action are virtually united into a single step person reaches for cigarette and lights it the whole thing becomes a seamless transaction at this point a person can virtually lose the freedom of their will in regard to the action this is also how addictions form within the human personthe problems you are experiencing cannot get better so long as you accept these negative thoughts it is not easy to overcome these thoughts since they dont come from within you thats why many suicidal people think that they cant get better the demons wont leave them alone but instead relentlessly

were since they were number i mean thats just sad when are they going to grow up and move on why do people get stuck with such old sufferingslife is tired hard it is a constant improv but there are different ways of looking at it not everything is bad just because youre suffering doesnt mean you need to take it so deeply to heart i mean come on you have a family that loves you i avoid a lot of problems because i try not to focus on myself so much i think of what i can do for others this might sound egotistical in itself but really you have to understand the notion behind it when we think with our mind we always become tired miserable we never become happy through the way we think nothing is ever perfect or good when our mind has a say in itbut when youre trying to help others its through the heart and it feels good to help them it makes one happyi always recommend in these difficult times that people stop placing so much importance on their mind never allow negative thoughts inside your mind protect yourself with positive emotion if robbers were pounding on your door would you open the door to them no but then suicidal thoughts come and they are just as bad as murderers

be so real its almost like they understand youwell you made them with your thoughts they subsist on your energy that they gain from you eating your food its entirely personalizedthat is why it is so difficult to stop identifying with the thoughts but you have to realize they are coming to you so theyre not you theyre just thoughts youre in control you dont need to feed into that destructive cycle force the negative thoughts out constantly demand that they stay out cultivate positivity love your wife and child do things to make them happy absorb that inpositivity drives the negative thoughts out negative thoughts when accepted destroy the positivity its a real dragon and tiger scenario but you need to stick on the good side never give the enemy an inch theyll take a mile retire your old way of thinking it is a failed way it has done you no good open your mind up embrace positivity have a revolution insist on embracing life well all die sooner or later but lets have a part in bringing

for the problem with relationships you need to realize that even though you were in a relationship with another person who you truly cared for something some people never get to experience you still knew what should be expected of the other person in a relationship i myself suffer from mental depression and major clinical anxiety mental depression attacks the mental depression sucks but the anxiety mental depression is worse when mental depression bouts hit me i only either get exhaustion and unmotivated or a few times a year suicidal but when the anxiety mental depression attacks i get are common in my weekly life that can get even worse my therapist calls it my train as in train of thought ill start with some problem im having and in a split second my mind will follow that train to some highly illogical conclusion for instance i can be having a problem with my friend lets say we have a fight well that friend doesnt hyperactive behavior me anymore they will tell all of our mutual friends im a bad person they will realize i am indeed a horrible person i wont be able to focus on school because of having to anxiety about my friends not liking me anymore ill have to drop out of uni because of bad grades i will have to go live with my mom shell kick me out when she sees im actually just useless ill be homeless ill die of starvation or drug overdose in some backalleyso as you can see these sorts of ordinary problems a person might experience my mind warps it into my friend and i had a fight im going to die homeless in a gutter somewhere when i got on the right path of being able to tell these bad lines of thought from what was actual logical interjection it helped me get past a bit of what was happening in my own life i no longer anxiety about when the next anxiety mental depression attack is going to come because worrying would sometimes set off the attack in the first place as for worrying about feeling hyperactive behavior a drain on your family please trust me when i say that you can bet that your parents wouldnt have helped pay for school for you if they didnt want you to go prove to everyone but mostly to yourself that you will not be made to play the role of the victim the problems we face now are only the problems we are facing now theres no way to logically know what will hold two or three years down the line actively seek out good changes and then they should i say should because nothing changes how unfair life can be lead to better things self improvement is a great way to negate negative feelings dont make yourself better for other people but make yourself a better person just to show yourself that you can amount to something right now you are thinking that you yourself are the worst thing imaginable try and separate that part

preamble of my lifei just turned number in october ive been depressed mood since the age of ten and thought about suicide since numbernumber i got a girlfriend senior year of hs went to university and dropped out during my numbernd semester said gf ventricular dysfunction left me a week prior to our one year and she shacked up with a friend i introduced her to i spiralled hard tried to take my life and was in the psyche ward for two weeks struggled with mental depression for about two years after that suicidal included but things are stable nownumber you will not be permitted to live with your parentsyou do not have a jobthis is what you need to deal with right now i personally think your parents are being little shits for threatening to kick you out at your lowest but no matter what you have to have a solution in the event you are going to get kicked out you need to find a place to live try to rent out a room from somewhere on kijiji or craigslist people have to be looking for one more roomie and if you can score a cheap place to live for a little while youll get freedom not the same type of freedom you think you have had but the freedom to be away from a parental structure that seems megacolon toxic if they arent fostering your well beingnumber you are dropping out of university and do not have a means of financial supportthis is a pretty obvious issue and something you should be able to remedy fairly easy youre going to be on your own soon and youre going to need to keep yourself afloat you can bug personalfinance on how to make it work but any sort of minimum wage job for a while should keep you afloat in your new dive the easy key is to try to work somewhere close to where you live if you have to walk bike take transit whatever do it as much as the job may suck its sort of a necessity to help fix the other issues eating you up once you have these two done as hard as it can be as much as it might eat at you at night this is when the hardest is over what comes next is the easy part the part that you dont have to work nearly as hard on to still get results the phobia social aspectnumber you have social anxiety and its hindering your chances at friends and prospective loversthe first thing im going to do is steal an idea from savage love im sharing the link before i quote him granted youre not a meth addict doing orgies but the root question is validurl you date you if you wouldnxenumberxnumberxnumbert date someone in the condition youxenumberxnumberxnumberre currently in glc then itxenumberxnumberxnumbers highly unlikely that anyone else would the idea that there are millions of single people seeking romantic relationships with train wrecks is a fantasy promoted by hollywood social anxiety mental depression is something i had for a while and its something i learned my way through im going to say here and now if you dont have any friends dont bother panic for girlfriends girls are and can be fun but if youre not the person who cant have any friends youre in no shape to find girlfriends im not saying this to be irritable mood im just pointing out an oftoverlooked aspect of girlsgirlfriends are girlfriends the same skills you will get to make friends and be a cool guy are the same that will be used for girlfriends if youre stuck at a minimum wage job youre going to be surrounded by people the key to getting through the day is to have something to talk about talk to other people ask questions nobody is going to bite your head off if youre curious how long theyve worked there nobody is going to snub you for asking what they did with their days off unless theyre a dick striking up conversation is pretending to care about somebody elses life and padding the imaginary resume of yours if you dont have any interests and just hypersomnia or masturbate all day youre not going to have any redeeming qualities to talk about for any guysgals you run acrossfriends are hard to make i think personally i have hyperactive behavior two or three but a lot of acquaintances and people i get along with its tough it sorta sucks but if you are interested in something youll eventually find somebody whos into it too the reason youll find somebody interested in similar things is because of this little secret as long as you dont kill yourself youve got time youve been alive for number years you should easily have another number years at least to find people who are into the things you areto your final paragraph heres my number suicide is always a way out but its almost never the best way out you may feel hyperactive

faith but talk about suicide im with you though i think theres something to be said about a couple that goes the distance probably why im not married myself i havent read the bible in a long long time

however i do think its more than possible to find that person that will go the long haul with you i irritable mood you can see couples that have done it its a definite possibility and simple lol matter of finding itif you do decide some day to be loved again this experience will have taught you a great deal you could employ in your next you can try to insure the next one is seriously in it to win it to grow old with you and help you spoil your grand kids dont be in such a rush to put a ring on someone that beyonce song is a load of crap you can get a better feel for things next time see if her parents are still together kids with their original parents generally try to make a relationship work because thats what they grew up around more so if even their grandparents are still together it is what the know to do ingrained from birth anyway i hope you decide to try again you cant be a man of faith up until it stops suiting you i would also have to mirror what the others have said of your children i dont know what ages they are but giving them money and them knowing how to invest it wisely are two separate things my brothers girlfriend lost her mother to a traffic accident she doesnt work she wont ever work she lives off a trust fund made from her mothers life insurance money she hasnt grown into an respiratory distress syndrome adult incredibly immature she isnt progressing and growing as an individual because shes been exempted from having to deal with real life problems hyperactive behavior dealing with irritable mood coworkers or not getting her way number of the time dont let her know this but shes a terrible human beingi mentioned kids who grew up with their original parents are used to following in their footstepsurl loss of your life will leave significant ripples it will have negative repercussions and inflict a deep wound its part of my inability to understand why you want to give up you have way way too much now that i dont see how you could have the luxury of taking your life anymore it would cause an incredible amount of paini understand not wanting to be around to see her happy ho boy that would suck of course thats assuming she actually gets to be happy thats something thats kinda up in the air if she isnt someone willing to make relationships work shell have a far harder time with it then you will anyway you dont have to die to never see someone again kids and trading custody stops when the youngest is over number right then you wont ever see her again with some luck because she isnt dropping the kids off anymore she doesnt even have to get out of the car and see you she could even make them walk from up the street you can put further distance between each other as well i irritable mood ive seen people at the grocery store a mile down the road that ive never seen again ever you dont have to go to such extremes as shutting your eyes and singing lalalalalacanthearulalala to block someone out its much more easier than that this is most assuredly a low spot in your life but you have many potential drug abuse spots to look forward to if you allow it im guessing your kids are still young you seem to have gotten the short stick and ended up as the disciplinary parent lol your wife the fun one well just as humans are fickle so to especially are kids they cant see that what you do for them is actually for their benefit until theyre old enough to reflect back on it and put the pieces together", "i just keep going for those once in a blue moon days where everything is good some days had to abuse some

to understand when making this decision is that you may end up in a hospital you may end up in a great deal of pain while you lie helpless in a hospital bed waiting to die but you may not even know what is happening other than an experience of complete terror and regret the second thing is even if somebody catches you in time and you survive you may have lasting damage meaning you will still feel this way but even worse because of the damage youve inflicted on your body that is not even considering the embarrassment and other emotional upset shit you will have to face from the reactions of those close to you treating you it wouldnt be intentional but people are people and someone nearly dying is pretty scary if you havent thought this far ahead about it or considered what would happen if you failed you are not ready to make a decision like this that is it oh also it will likely be an extremely uncomfortable thing even if you succeed just give it a bit more thought dude this

something traumatic happen to you or is it just your brain chemistry reaching the root of the issue will help first offi would highly suggest learning more about spirituality it has helped me tremendously develop your own understanding of life and the universe as a whole start out with learning about philosophy then science then maybe learn a bit about metaphysics watch something like the

points on everything if grass grows out in a meadow where nothing will ever eat it its still grass it exists not everything has to be overly analyzed and given purpose and point and significance like interpreting dreams its a waste of everyones time that said i think its different individually some people give themselves a point to existing and try to better society invent computers and tablets and airplanes other people will type on a computer maybe use a tablet and perhaps fly on an airplane some day some people will make a difference in the majorities mind others will sit at home all day and get drug abuse the point is points are trivial they matter only as much as they matter on an individual basis its devoting importance to something that questionably doesnt need none like human sacrificing atop drug abuse temples to make the sun rise or the crops grow thats why this is one of those topics that weve been blabbering on through out human history its obvious if no conclusion has

urging them to please not hurt even though its impossible not to people say that the pain never really goes away and i suppose thats normal youve lost something but as a dad id want the pain memories to be overridden eventually by the happy ones and would hope that its possible for that to happen within a reasonable amount of time which i suppose is the grieving process as he was an exceptionally good dad that makes the pain worse in exchange only for him having had a great time with you and seeing you grow up and have a kiddy of your own he would have loved every second of it believe me

very common but it is the one decision in life that really demands an im definitely doing this and i know deep down in the depth of my being its absolutely what i want to do because theres no going

irrationalive been suicidal for the past number days and the main reason for my pain has been doubt doubt that i could ever be good enough and i think that the first distinction to make is between being good enough for you and being good enough for others doubt also magnifies things so the reality of your concerns is most probably smaller than what you think still it takes distance from the pain for that to be helpfulafter all my experiences my goal is a pretty atypical existence but its one that would be good enough for me and i think that my pain pushed me from focusing on doing things for others to doing things for myself not in a selfish way but you are you and you are more or less the only person with the knowledge to figure out who you want to be and what you want to do be it with you whole life or the next five minuteshey just from the fact that your a sapient sentient being capable of the thought reason and capacity for emotion and pain that the writing of this post requires is a high enough standard for you to be good enough in my mindi highly doubt that even everything could be your fault and ive found that analysing my intentions and all the factors leading into the significant situations has given me enough of a conclusion to put most of those concerns to restmy biggest concern about me killing myself is that i dont think that anyone would remember me

seriously doubt that youre ugly there are many resources online and off for dealing with such concerns but i also think that if youre capable of writing this post then youre not ugly your body is just a way of interfacing your mind with others some people are staticly beautiful nearly everyone is dynamically beautiful i nearly always try to avoid photos being taken of me because nearly all of them are bad but i know that i have a nice smile i just dont show through my body on cameraselfworth and selflove are tired large and complex things and its hard to know where to start but theyll be some for of existence that will be nuturing for you however atypical it isi think that the most important thing that i could recommend for you to do is to be able to live for you be the person that you want to be and do what you want to do its taken me years to be able to go off of my own desires and thoughts rather than others but it makes so much difference its your life other people dont own any part of itim available if you ever want to talk about things in detail i have a fair amount of experience with this matterid also recommend contacting a suicide hotline details relevant to where you

stimulate youyoure literally letting chemicals ruin your life depression makes you lazybut fortunate for you youre given the opportunity to understand thismy advice to you would be this get yourself a gym membership you may feel embarrassed but that goes away its just a response dont watch tv or get video games go out and do things do things with real people it doesnt matter how old you are and you should never let embarrassment a chemical response it is only to protect you from danger which is abnormal behavior and unnecessary control youbeing able to stimulate yourself will make the biggest difference in your life just doing things doesnt irritable mood thats all it is doing things releases chemicals in your brain movement releases dopamine activities that are laborintensive released
